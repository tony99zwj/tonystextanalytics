Greatest CLIKKs of 2021GOLD MEDALIST The Periodic Table of Email MarketingBefore we re-introduce this splendid piece of content, let\\'s say a wordor two about why it won the gold (since ranked lists are naturallycontroversial and all).\\\\ufe0f It won the numbers. It wasn\\'t a landslide victory in everyconceivable way, no. But this link can boast a strongly positiveaudience response, the single highest click-to-open rate (CTOR) for2021\\'s links, and a repeat-click rate well above the 90th percentile. Wedidn\\'t rank the Greatest CLIKKs algorithmically, but it would have beenranked #1 in most algorithms I could imagine.\\\\ufe0f It was the most creative of the high performers. To be honest, Ihad a really hard time picking between this and HBR\\'s Elements of Value(which also had very strong numbers) for the top spot. In the end, whatbroke the tie was the guideline I\\'d read about the Peabody Awards, thateach entry is judged on its own merits (\"Excellence On Its Own Terms\"),and the uniqueness factor of the Periodic Table was the tiebreaker.Our only preface is that you do have to trade an email address for thefull PDF version of this content. Having said that, it\\'s a veryfavorable trade for you.Now, by way of re-introduction:The Table covers 61 different \"elements\" of email marketing you mightever need to pay attention to-and perhaps needless to say, the baseusefulness of this content is collecting all of those elements in oneplace together (like a checklist). Those 61 elements fall into the following eight categories:Audience  Building a relationship of some kind with the real humanbeings opening your mailsContent  Creating the \"actual stuff\" of your marketing emails, thensetting it up and displaying it for the readerCompliance  Making sure you\\'re following all the laws, rules,regulations, and permissionsInfrastructure  Getting all of the appropriate \"wires\" connected inthe right ways with your domain, email provider, etc.Trust  Establishing and maintaining your track record as a safe,non-spammy email senderExperimental  All of the unproven (but potentially awesome) newstuff in email marketingToxins \\\\u2620\\\\ufe0f Avoiding behaviors that hurt your deliverability, listhealth, or trustworthinessTraps \\\\u26a0\\\\ufe0f Steering clear of other hazards created or configuredbeyond your control (corporate filters, for example)The Table itself is on page 4 of the PDF, and each of the eightcategories gets an explanatory page in the PDF after that, for 12 pagesin total. It doesn\\'t go into tremendous detail, but it doesn\\'t have todo so to be excellent.Here\\'s that link again. Pop Culture Revue IIFavorite Marketing Crossovers Bill and Ted\\'s Electric Adventure.Alex and Keanu have arip-roaring good time driving the all-electric Porsche Taycan in thisdelightful promo video which shows (off) how much spirited driving youcan do on a single charge. Bill Nye the Sapphire Guy.Apparently Bill Nye (of Science Guy fame) is a gin drinker. He\\'s becomean advertising favorite and social-media influencer now that hisaudience is drinking age and this isn\\'t scandalous. Halo 3\\'sJaw-Droppingly Good Ad.The game had marketingdollars for some ambitious ad experiments, and this one paid off big. Itcompletely disarmed me when I first saw it (and it continues to impressme) because it\\'s so beautifully dissonant. This is atestosterone-friendly action game, and yet here it\\'s represented by aChopin prelude and a motionless handmade diorama. Damn.Hadn\\'t seen it for a decade until this articlefrom The Drum reminded me.\\\\u26fd\\\\ufe0f Ford\\'s Gasoline-Scented Cologne.It\\'s called Mach Eau, which translates roughly to \"speed water.\" TheAnchorman references write themselves. If You Argue Correctly, You\\'re Never Wrong.We mentioned that theMarlboro Man campaign was hugely successful for Philip Morris, whichprompted us to recommend Thank You For Smoking. It\\'s our kind of comedy,but it\\'s also piercingly intelligent about argumentation andpositioning. The seven words in the anchor text constitute but one ofthe movie\\'s lessons. When an Eel Climbs a Ramp to Eat Squid From a Clamp, That\\'s aMoray.Easily our favorite headline of 2021. The subject matter is way outsideof our usual reading (and Dean Martin isn\\'t exactly everyday listeningfor us), but the headline wins and the runner-up is nowhere in sight.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

Greatest CLIKKs of 2021GOLD MEDALIST The Periodic Table of Email MarketingBefore we re-introduce this splendid piece of content, let\\'s say a wordor two about why it won the gold (since ranked lists are naturallycontroversial and all).\\\\ufe0f It won the numbers. It wasn\\'t a landslide victory in everyconceivable way, no. But this link can boast a strongly positiveaudience response, the single highest click-to-open rate (CTOR) for2021\\'s links, and a repeat-click rate well above the 90th percentile. Wedidn\\'t rank the Greatest CLIKKs algorithmically, but it would have beenranked #1 in most algorithms I could imagine.\\\\ufe0f It was the most creative of the high performers. To be honest, Ihad a really hard time picking between this and HBR\\'s Elements of Value(which also had very strong numbers) for the top spot. In the end, whatbroke the tie was the guideline I\\'d read about the Peabody Awards, thateach entry is judged on its own merits (\"Excellence On Its Own Terms\"),and the uniqueness factor of the Periodic Table was the tiebreaker.Our only preface is that you do have to trade an email address for thefull PDF version of this content. Having said that, it\\'s a veryfavorable trade for you.Now, by way of re-introduction:The Table covers 61 different \"elements\" of email marketing you mightever need to pay attention to-and perhaps needless to say, the baseusefulness of this content is collecting all of those elements in oneplace together (like a checklist). Those 61 elements fall into the following eight categories:Audience  Building a relationship of some kind with the real humanbeings opening your mailsContent  Creating the \"actual stuff\" of your marketing emails, thensetting it up and displaying it for the readerCompliance  Making sure you\\'re following all the laws, rules,regulations, and permissionsInfrastructure  Getting all of the appropriate \"wires\" connected inthe right ways with your domain, email provider, etc.Trust  Establishing and maintaining your track record as a safe,non-spammy email senderExperimental  All of the unproven (but potentially awesome) newstuff in email marketingToxins \\\\u2620\\\\ufe0f Avoiding behaviors that hurt your deliverability, listhealth, or trustworthinessTraps \\\\u26a0\\\\ufe0f Steering clear of other hazards created or configuredbeyond your control (corporate filters, for example)The Table itself is on page 4 of the PDF, and each of the eightcategories gets an explanatory page in the PDF after that, for 12 pagesin total. It doesn\\'t go into tremendous detail, but it doesn\\'t have todo so to be excellent.Here\\'s that link again. Pop Culture Revue IIFavorite Marketing Crossovers Bill and Ted\\'s Electric Adventure.Alex and Keanu have arip-roaring good time driving the all-electric Porsche Taycan in thisdelightful promo video which shows (off) how much spirited driving youcan do on a single charge. Bill Nye the Sapphire Guy.Apparently Bill Nye (of Science Guy fame) is a gin drinker. He\\'s becomean advertising favorite and social-media influencer now that hisaudience is drinking age and this isn\\'t scandalous. Halo 3\\'sJaw-Droppingly Good Ad.The game had marketingdollars for some ambitious ad experiments, and this one paid off big. Itcompletely disarmed me when I first saw it (and it continues to impressme) because it\\'s so beautifully dissonant. This is atestosterone-friendly action game, and yet here it\\'s represented by aChopin prelude and a motionless handmade diorama. Damn.Hadn\\'t seen it for a decade until this articlefrom The Drum reminded me.\\\\u26fd\\\\ufe0f Ford\\'s Gasoline-Scented Cologne.It\\'s called Mach Eau, which translates roughly to \"speed water.\" TheAnchorman references write themselves. If You Argue Correctly, You\\'re Never Wrong.We mentioned that theMarlboro Man campaign was hugely successful for Philip Morris, whichprompted us to recommend Thank You For Smoking. It\\'s our kind of comedy,but it\\'s also piercingly intelligent about argumentation andpositioning. The seven words in the anchor text constitute but one ofthe movie\\'s lessons. When an Eel Climbs a Ramp to Eat Squid From a Clamp, That\\'s aMoray.Easily our favorite headline of 2021. The subject matter is way outsideof our usual reading (and Dean Martin isn\\'t exactly everyday listeningfor us), but the headline wins and the runner-up is nowhere in sight.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

Guests include S&P Global Sustainable1 president Richard Mattison and Moody’s Climate Solutions global head Emilie Mazzacurati. Register here. \\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Federal securities regulators went on a rule-making spree yesterday, including new proposals related to executive stock trading and corporate share buybacks.Why it matters: This felt like a giant throat-clearing, as the SEC prepares to address issues like crypto and SPACs in 2022.Next year also could see new disclosure requirements related to climate risk, cybersecurity risk and human capital management.Insider trading: The SEC wants to tighten Rule 10b5-1, which permits pre-approved stock sale plans by top executives. Such trades hit new highs in 2021.Rule 10b5-1 was designed to prevent insiders from trading on material information, but doesn\\'t. The SEC\\'s proposal would require a trading plan to be in place for at least 120 days before actual sales can occur, and also for greater disclosure.It\\'s also worth noting that, on the same day the SEC looked to crack down on corporate executive sales, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly said that Congress will keep looking the other way when it comes to its own members.Stock buybacks: The SEC wants companies to disclose share repurchases within one business day, and also to explain \"the objective or rationale for the share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the repurchase amount.\"Visa yesterday announced that its board has approved a $12 billion share buyback program. Overall, corporate stock buybacks are on pace for a record year.The SEC also proposed new money market rules, in which it would increase liquidity requirements and buffers, and new disclosure requirements on security-based swaps.The bottom line: Gary Gensler is just getting started.\\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyReddit said that it has filed confidential IPO documents with the SEC, with Reuters reporting that it will seek around a $15 billion valuation.Why it\\'s the BFD: Reddit\\'s IPO would be the poetic capper to a year of meme stock madness.ROI: Reddit was bought in 2006 by Condé Nast for just $10 million, but since has raised over $1.3 billion in private funding. Its most recent round was this past summer, when Fidelity led a $410 million Series F round at a $10 billion post-money valuation.Bottom line: \"Nearly all of Reddit\\'s social networking competitors are already public... The last big private one is ByteDance.\" — Felix Salmon, Axios\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Rokt, a New York-based e-commerce marketing company, raised $325 million in Series E funding at a $1.95 billion valuation. Tiger Global led, and was joined by Wellington, Whale Rock, Pavilion Capital and insider Square Peg. http://axios.link/2nfX • Cockroach Labs, a New York-based distributed SQL database, raised $278 million in Series F funding at a $5 billion valuation.

I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m just about ready for this pandemic to end.Today\\'s word count: 1,432 words (5 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏈 HBCU lands No. 1 recruit\\xa0National Signing Day provided a stunner when the nation\\'s No. 1 recruit, cornerback Travis Hunter, de-committed from Florida State in favor of Jackson State, an FCS program and HBCU.Why it matters: Hunter is the first five-star high school prospect to sign with an FCS team (or HBCU) since ESPN began its rankings in 2006.After an 11-1 season under NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders\\' leadership, and with Hunter set to enter the fold, it\\'s safe to say Jackson State might garner some attention next year.🎥\\xa0Watch: Hunter\\'s announcement (Twitter)The big picture: It\\'s impossible to know whether Hunter\\'s historic decision will lead to more top prospects carving their own path at less heralded schools, but it certainly feels like an inflection point.With the rise of NIL, players like Hunter may in fact earn more as a big fish in a small pond.And regarding HBCUs, perhaps last years\\' hoops recruiting cycle — when various top prospects considered HBCUs but just one signed — was a prelude to this moment. \"Historically Black Colleges and Universities have a rich history in football. I want to be part of that history, and more, I want to be part of that future. I am making this decision so that I can light the way for others to follow, make it a little easier for the next player to recognize that HBCUs may be everything you want and more.\" — Hunter, on TwitterMore from Signing Day:🥇 Top classes: Alabama finished the day with the No. 1 class, per 247Sports, followed by Ohio State and LSU. But over at ESPN, which ranks slightly differently, Texas A&M finished first, followed by Alabama and Georgia.💔 Michigan Tate: The Spartans made Tate Myre — the 16-year-old who sacrificed his life during last month\\'s Oxford High shooting — an honorary Spartan Dawg, which \"is defined not by the plays they make ... but by the character they exemplify,\" said coach Mel Tucker.Go deeper: Signing Day roundup (ESPN)\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL power rankings: Week 15Table: Axios VisualsThe Packers took over the top spot in our weekly rankings, which have become increasingly difficult to make as the wheat refuses to create any separation from the chaff.State of play: With four weeks remaining, all but six teams either hold or are within one game of a playoff spot thanks to a bloated middle class comprising 15 teams sitting at 7-6, 6-7 or 6-6-1.For the first time since 2017, no team has clinched the playoffs with four weeks left.For the first time since 2014, every team has at least three losses through Week 14.For the first time since *1970*, both conferences have a three-way tie for best record through Week 14.📆\\xa0Coming up ...

Just 4 of 30 MLB general managers, 5 of 32 NFL head coaches and 4 of 27 MLS team presidents or CEOs are people of color.The big picture: 2020\\'s racial reckoning helped lay the groundwork for change decades in the making.

       " 'Plus: The out-of-office life | Wednesday, December 15, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By PwC\\xa0Axios FutureByBryan Walsh·Dec 15, 2021Welcome to Axios Future, where we\\'re not done quite yet.Today\\'s third-to-last edition looks at democratic backsliding, a better way to remote work, and the best sci-fi show you should be watching (and reading).Today\\'s Smart Brevity count: 1,560 words or about 6 minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: The global decline of democracyIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Democratic governance is sliding backward in the U.S. and much of the world, according to a series of recent reports.Why it matters: The future will be shaped by the push and pull of democratic and autocratic forces within countries and beyond their borders. If supporters of democracies can\\'t halt democracy\\'s retreat, freedom and civil liberties could follow.Driving the news: President Biden held an online Summit for Democracy at the end of last week against the backdrop of pessimistic assessments about the health of democratic government globally. In its 2021 report, the nonprofit Freedom House concluded the world is in a \"long democratic recession,\" with democracy improving in only 28 countries while worsening in 73 — the biggest gap of the past 15 years.A recent report from the European think tank International IDEA found the number of \"backsliding democracies\" had doubled over the past decade and the number of countries moving in an authoritarian direction since 2020 outnumbered those going in a democratic direction. Data from the Swedish nonprofit V-Dem that was analyzed by the New York Times found the U.S. and its allies were responsible for an outsized share of global democratic backsliding over the past decade.Between the lines: The data signals that for all the legitimate concerns about the rise of clearly autocratic countries like Russia and China, when it comes to democratic decline, the alarm is coming from inside the house. Biden\\'s democracy summit included plenty of steadfast democracies, but also leaders like India\\'s Narendra Modi and Brazil\\'s Jair Bolsonaro who preside over countries that have experienced a steep democratic decline. American democracy is arguably at risk as well — International IDEA included the U.S. on its \"backsliding democracies\" list amidst the passage of state laws that make it harder to vote and the installation of partisan loyalists in key election posts. The world has taken notice of democratic struggles within the U.S. — a recent Pew Research Center study found only 17% of people in surveyed countries called American democracy worth emulating, and 23% said it was never a good example.  What they\\'re saying: In his opening remarks at last week\\'s summit, President Biden called democratic erosion — which he blamed in part on the dissatisfaction of citizens with their democratic governments — \"the defining challenge of our time.\"The big picture: Democratic decline stems in part from the pandemic, as governments pursue policies to control the virus that involve restricting civil liberties like free movement and as citizens become frustrated that those policies haven\\'t yet brought an end to COVID-19.But as income inequality and more general feelings of insecurity rise, life in an illiberal democracy may seem preferable to the complexities of living under a full democracy.That means, as Biden told Congress in an address in April, that democratic leaders have to prove \"that our government still works — and we can deliver for our people.\"Context: Authoritarian countries like China are taking advantage of democratic woes to tout their own systems, Axios\\' Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian reported recently.What to watch: How free and fair U.S. elections in 2022 and 2024 are.America is still the democratic bellwether, and a repeat of the chaos of 2020 — or something worse — would be a crippling blow to democracies around the world.Share this story.\\xa0\\xa02. A better work life awaits \"Out of Office\"Credit: Penguin\\xa0The authors of a new book argue the shift to remote work holds the potential to change work life for the better.Why it matters: As the Omicron variant puts the final nail in the coffin of a quick return to the office, it\\'s long past time to figure out better work habits for a remote and hybrid era that will be with us for the long haul. What\\'s happening: In their new book \"Out of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working from Home,\" journalists Charlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen say remote work could be a boon in the future — provided it doesn\\'t resemble the lonely, dysfunctional experience many of us have had for the past 20 months.\"We have to leave behind this understanding that whatever we have been doing before is what we will be doing moving forward,\" Petersen told me at an event today. \"There are so many different and better ways to arrange remote work.\"How (we) work: To prevent remote work from becoming all-consuming, Warzel and Petersen say companies need to establish meaningful guardrails between life and work, even if the latter is no longer taking place at the office.And just as importantly, those guardrails need to be guarded by people in power.\"Too often, we celebrate the people who break those boundaries,\" said Warzel. \"Instead, if someone breaks those rules, it means a manager should be taking them aside as they would if they broke some other code of conduct.\"Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa03. Losing our religionReproduced from Pew Research Center; Chart: Axios VisualsThe share of religiously unaffiliated Americans nearly doubled over the past 15 years to 29%, per a Pew Research Center survey cited in Mike Allen\\'s Axios PM.Christians of all varieties make up 63% of the adult population — down from 75% a decade ago.Between the lines: Most of the increase in what Pew calls \"nones\" comes from the decline of Protestantism.40% of U.S. adults are Protestants, down from 52% in 2007.The big picture: The religiously unaffiliated are no longer crowded in coastal cities, Santa Clara adjunct professor Elizabeth Drescher told AP.They\\'re now spread across all regions, age ranges, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds.Go deeper.\\xa0\\xa0A message from PwCThe Great Resignation is here \\xa0\\xa0PwC’s Pulse Survey: Next in Work reveals that employees want more flexibility, benefits and pay, but employers are only delivering on flexibility.How can you balance strategic and operational goals with shifting employee expectations?

Image: Epic Games, Warner Bros.\\xa0Epic Games is using a new demo set in the world of The Matrix to both tout its own capabilities and make the case that photorealistic video games are within reach, as Axios Gaming co-author Stephen Totilo reports.Why it matters: Long before Fortnite made Epic the behemoth it is today, the company\\'s Unreal Engine game development tech greatly influenced how games were made and what they looked like.The demo, dubbed The Matrix Awakens, was made using Epic\\'s forthcoming Unreal Engine 5 and consists of a non-interactive sequence featuring mostly digital versions of actors Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, followed by a playable car chase.Between the lines: The demo is designed to show what is possible on the newer consoles.The studio had shown a head-turning UE5 demo in mid-2020, but this demo is playable for free on the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.Epic hopes Matrix Awakens shows that the future of gaming and the metaverse need not rely on the cartoonish avatars of today.\"We\\'re trying to basically eliminate the uncanny valley of plausibility when it comes to characters and environment,\" Epic\\'s chief technology officer Kim Libreri told Axios.\\xa0\\xa05.

A little more than a week later, the premiere of the sixth and final season of \"The Expanse\" premiered on Amazon Prime.Why you should read (and watch): A lot of sci-fi series can create a memorable, meaningful setting. What sets \"The Expanse\" apart in its original form and its adaptation is its realism, grounded in actual physics — no transporters or warp engines — and actual politics.Even in the final novel, which sees the protagonists grappling with an extradimensional existential threat to humanity, you never forget that these are recognizable human beings, divided by tribe, ideology and power struggles.Between the lines: Compared to the utopian \"Star Trek\" with its fully automated luxury communism of an economy, or the fantasy series with space ships that is \"Star Wars,\" \"The Expanse\" can feel unremittingly grim, no more escapist than reading the daily paper.Yes, but: That\\'s the point — \"The Expanse\" envisions a future where humanity can colonize Mars and mine asteroids, but inequality, poverty and division still exist.\"The Expanse\" counts as optimistic sci-fi for the simple reason that it imagines a future where humanity continues to exist and strive, to fail and rise again.The bottom line: And unlike a certain dragon-centric medieval fantasy series, its creators actually managed to bring it to a satisfying conclusion on time.\\xa0\\xa0A message from PwCHow to boost trust in your company \\xa0\\xa0PwC’s Trust in US Business Survey reveals that the definition of trust is multidimensional and not everyone sees trust the same way.How is trust defined?

He\\'ll be back in your inboxes tomorrow! \\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Brendan Lynch/Axios\\xa0In a hearing later today, the Senate\\'s judiciary committee will attempt to examine the impact of large and dominant companies on \"American innovation\" — that is, startups — and their ability to acquire smaller ones.  Why it matters: Whether Big Tech is preventing startups from realizing their full potential remains a key debate within the tech industry. The industry benefits from a thriving competitive market where new companies have a shot a creating fresh products, yet struggles to fully reject big companies\\' dominance as they are the ultimate expression of winning at the capitalism competition. Flashback: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who chairs the committee, recently introduced the \"Platform Competition and Opportunity Act of 2021\" along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) as an attempt to curb Big Tech\\'s efforts to remain dominant by acquiring smaller companies.The bill aims to make M&A much harder for companies with a market cap of $600 billion or more that have at least 50 million U.S.-based monthly active users or at least 100,000 U.S.-based monthly active business users. (It applies to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, while exempting others like Walmart, at least for now.)  Between the lines: As we\\'ve written about before, much of startupland is horrified at the idea that being acquired by a larger company could no longer be a viable option for upstarts that don’t make it all the way to an IPO. \"If I\\'m a founder or I\\'m an investor, and I\\'m thinking about starting a company in a core market of an incumbent ... what if Plan B (M&A) is not an option? That changes things,\" Trinity Ventures\\' Patricia Nakache said last year during a DOJ event in Silicon Valley.The argument is: Big Tech gobbling up startups isn’t a deterrent to entrepreneurship — it s an enabler. Yes, but: Not everyone agrees, even within the tech industry, and some investors and entrepreneurs do want to see Big Tech\\'s M&A activities limited. Their argument is that large companies are so big that many startups can never take them on successfully with newer products. They\\'re also so rich that they can make acquisition offers that startups can\\'t refuse — even if it means they\\'ll have to shut down their businesses. The bottom line: It\\'s unlikely that startupland will ever see eye-to-eye with Klobuchar on this issue — M&A is too integral to what keeps the ecosystem running.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Anchorage Digital, a San Francisco-based company providing digital assets custody and management for institutions, raised $350 million in Series D funding at a $3 billion valuation led by KKR.

Lovecraft once said that \"the most merciful thing in the world isthe inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\" That\\'s amore specific variation upon ignorance is bliss, and we\\'d tend to agreewith him when it comes to the totality of human knowledge (and whatevereldritch horrors lurk beyond it).At the same time, there\\'s a very thin line between ignorance andstupidity. Even if ignorance is bliss, it\\'s a terrible way to live yourlife. Stay in school, kids.We\\'re practical people-and in that view, perhaps Lovecraft had itbackwards.Sometimes \"correlating the contents\" is actually the most merciful thinganyone can do. It\\'s certainly true for subjects like SEO, where it\\'seasy to get lost and you wish you had a map of some kind.Ahem.Yup. There\\'s a site which is basically dedicated to mapping out SEO.This could be tremendously useful for newbies and veterans alike, butwe\\'ll offer three quick notes before you jump in:1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 The image above is just a sample (four sections of nine) andit\\'s best to think of the progression as General To Detailed, ratherthan Easy To Hard.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 This is an index, not a digital classroom. The site is notdesigned to spoon-feed you all of the information; it\\'s just designed toorganize it in one place.3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 There\\'s no way we could have reviewed ALL of the materialslinked here. It\\'s a lot of stuff. So we\\'ll just split the audience thisway: If you\\'re experienced enough to be skeptical about the information, thendive in anywhere. But if you\\'re a newbie who is (no blame attached)liable to believe whatever you read, it\\'s best to think of this as aglossary for SEO vocabulary and a taxonomy for what you\\'ll learn furtherdown the line.Pop Culture Revue INAME the SUBJECT-LINE REFERENCESThe Last King of Silicon Valley (2/5)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This 2006 movie starring Forest Whitaker.\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f Whitaker portrayed this real-life dictator.SEO the Hedgehog (2/12)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This famed videogame character.\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The name of his orange sidekick.the Call of the WiFi (3/5)PREHEADER TEXT: And its sequel, WiFang.\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This author who wrote a twinned pair of novels.\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The names of his canine protagonists.Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like Aimee (5/7)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This champion boxer also famous for s**t-talking.\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The company using \"Impossible Is Nothing\" as a slogan.Amazon and The Wrath of Khan (7/2)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This popular American science-fiction franchise.\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The actor who portrayed its fictional Khan.Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Advice (9/17)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This fictional child who had a very bad day. \\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The author of the children\\'s book about it.Editors & Demons (11/17)\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f This author of the referenced best-seller (prequel to The DaVinci Code).\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f The actor who portrays the Camerlengo in the movie.All answers at the bottom.More pop-culture fun tomorrow!Greatest CLIKKs of 2021SILVER MEDALIST The Elements of Value Harvard Business ReviewPricing is a funny thing. In many ways, it\\'s a hard and well-establishedscience; it\\'s an equation you try to balance just so. At the same time, there\\'s definitely an art to pricing. You have tobalance the asking price against the customer\\'s perception of valuewhile actively shaping that perception of value. We\\'re marketing here,not just bean-counting.This requires psychology, not just math. If you really want to movethose prices (and profit margins) up, you have to change what peoplethink they\\'re buying rather than haggling over what they\\'re willing topay for a known thing.After all, it is not your pricing that produces happy, brand-fanaticalcustomers. It is the value you offer. It stands to reason that the moreyour product(s) can offer in customers\\' eyes, the more they\\'ll bewilling to pay.So now we arrive at this question, followed by HBR\\'s glorious answer:What are the different \"elements of value\" customers see?Well, there are 30 of them. They form a nice tidypyramid.  Speaking of which: they (very explicitly) modeled this structure onMaslow\\'s Hierarchy of Needs. You canthink of the pyramid above as HBR\\'s Hierarchy of Consumer Value. Butwe\\'d make two key clarifications here: YES, this does mean that higher sections offer stronger value.Though all elements in a section are equal (never mind the rows withinsections). NO, this does not require customers/products to work up frombottom. Customers can seek, and products can offer, elements of value inany section regardless of the others.To wrap up our part here, we have one sage example to illustrate thisconcept\\'s beauty and potential for marketers...Mastercard was struggling in the early \\'90s. But then, as if to teachus, they responded to that crisis with one of the longest-running, mostsuccessful campaigns in the history of advertising: Priceless. You know the words:There are some things money can\\'t buy. For everything else, there\\'s Mastercard.It\\'s got a ring to it, that\\'s for sure. But why is that angle so damneffective?Look back at the Elements of Value, and look at all of the elementsMastercard could have chosen. Theoretically, they could have chosen anyof them-their product allows you to buy virtually any otherproduct-and lower might have felt safer, since a credit card is (orwas) a pretty utilitarian thing.But they aimed really, really high on the pyramid. From the very firstad , they realized that thevalue of Mastercard is not just Simplification or Access or evenBelonging. Your Mastercard becomes Transcendent when it\\'s defined as away to enable the most important moments of your life.Now that, right there, is some marketing jiu-jitsu. Mastercard openedthe \\'90s with an uphill battle against consumer fears and objections,then closed the \\'90s shooting wishful fish in a high-interest barrel. And yes, we can mix all of those metaphors because the campaign reallyhas made that much differenceto their success.Subject-Line ReferencesThe Last King of Silicon Valley\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f The Last King of Scotland\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f Idi Amin of UgandaSEO the Hedgehog\\\\u27a1\\\\ufe0f Sonic the Hedgehog\\\\u21aa\\\\ufe0f Miles Prower, a.k.a.

Let\\'s do this.Today\\'s word count: 1,790 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏀 The greatest shooter of all time Photo: Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty ImagesSteph Curry made history Tuesday night at basketball\\'s Mecca, hitting his 2,974th career three-pointer in a 105-96 win over the Knicks to pass Ray Allen for most all time.Curry: 2,977Allen: 2,973Reggie Miller: 2,560James Harden: 2,509Kyle Korver: 2,450\"I never wanted to call myself the greatest shooter until I got that record. I\\'m comfortable saying that now.\"  Hang it in the Louvre. Photo: Evan Yu/NBAE via Getty ImagesThe scene: Curry entered the game needing two threes to break the record, hitting his first attempt just over a minute after the opening tip.Three minutes later, on a quick-trigger catch-and-shoot, he splashed a 28-footer and the Garden erupted.Play then stopped as Steph took in the moment and made his way around the arena to share embraces with Allen, his father, Dell, and his mother, Sonya.\"No better scenario than having Ray in the building and Reggie on the call. ... My respect for [them], guys who set the bar for what it meant to be a sharpshooter ... I\\'ve tried to own that in my journey.\" \"I pride myself on shooting a high percentage, I pride myself on that helping us win games. Now I can pride myself on the longevity of getting to that number Ray set, hopefully pushing it to a number nobody can reach.\"— Curry, after the gameThe big picture: Curry\\'s record-breaking three came 4,428 days after his first one, and in that time he\\'s become the catalyst that changed the league forever.In his rookie season (2009-10), teams attempted 18.1 threes a game. Now it\\'s up to 35.4 as the league has evolved around the analytics his transcendent play helped unearth.\"What he\\'s done has just completely redefined what\\'s a good shot,\" said coach Steve Kerr. \"It\\'s amazing how much he\\'s impacted the game both strategically and artistically.\"The bottom line: Curry\\'s been the greatest shooter on Earth for the better part of a decade. On Tuesday night, he made it official.Go deeper: Charting Steph\\'s greatness (Twitter)\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 QBs lead MVP race, as alwaysData: DraftKings; Table: Sara Wise/AxiosQuarterbacks are dominating the MVP race, led by 44-year-old Tom Brady, who\\'s heavily-favored to win his fourth award.Why it matters: QBs comprising eight of the top 10 MVP favorites (and 16 of the top 19) is par for the course in regards to an award that goes almost exclusively to signal-callers on the league\\'s best teams.By the numbers: 14 of the 22 MVPs since 2000 went to QBs on a top-two seed, four went to other playoff-bound QBs and four went to running backs with seasons too impressive or historic to overlook:2012: Adrian Peterson became the seventh player to rush for over 2,000 yards2000, 2005, 2006: Marshall Faulk (26 total TD), Shaun Alexander (28) and LaDainian Tomlinson (31) each broke the single-season TD record.State of play: This year is more of the same, as Josh Allen is the only QB among those top eight who\\'s currently more than a game out of a top-two seed. Can one of the non-hurlers make a similarly historic mark as the four guys above?Jonathan Taylor (+2000): He won\\'t reach 2,000 yards (on pace for 1,763), but his 18 total TD lead the league and he matched Tomlinson\\'s NFL record with eight consecutive games of 100+ scrimmage yards and a rushing TD.Cooper Kupp (+5000): He\\'s on pace for 148 receptions (one shy of the NFL record) and 1,947 receiving yards (17 shy). Yes, he gets an extra game to reach those numbers, but watch him play and tell me he isn\\'t having an all-time season.Go deeper: Can a running back win MVP?

But after dropping four straight, they\\'re now in the midst of a COVID outbreak.Biggest disappointment: The Montreal Canadiens were in the Stanley Cup Finals five months ago. Now, their 15 points are second-fewest in the league.Stat leaders:Points: Leon Draisaitl, EDM (45); Connor McDavid, EDM (45); Alex Ovechkin, WSH (44); Nazem Kadri, COL (37); three tied (33)Goals: Draisaitl (23); Ovechkin (20); Auston Matthews, TOR (20); Kyle Connor, WPG (18); three tied (17)Assists: McDavid (29); Kadri (26); Adam Fox, NYR (25); Ovechkin (24); Artemi Panarin, NYR (24)Goals against average: Frederik Andersen, CAR (1.92); Tristan Jarry, PIT (1.92); Jacob Markstrom, CGY (1.94); James Reimer, SJ (1.98); Jack Campbell, TOR (1.99)Save percentage: Reimer (.937); Igor Shesterkin, NYR (.937); Campbell (.937); Jarry (.934); Markstrom (.933)More NHL:Olympics: The NHL is set to participate in Beijing 2022 after the league skipped the 2018 Games, but some players are concerned about the possibility of a five-week quarantine in China if they test positive.

It seems he may have saved college basketball, too.Go deeper: How the NBA was saved on the back of a napkin (SI)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏈 NFL triviaPhoto: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\\xa0Brady and Rodgers are two of five NFL players with exactly three MVPs, all trailing Peyton Manning\\'s record five wins.Question: Which other three players have exactly three MVPs?Hint: Two QBs, one RBAnswer at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa010. 🏀 2,974 and counting Visualization: Courtesy of @kirkgoldsberry (Twitter)Behold, in all its glory, the greatest shooting career in NBA history.How many more are still to come?\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosLocal D.C.

I almost blackballed this one for the Greatest CLIKKsbecause I sold it VERY hard in its first mention. It got a lot ofclicks, yes, but not on a level playing field.I decided to allow it when I saw that this article had the highestrepeat-click rate of 2021. Translation: this was the link y\\'all werelikeliest to come back and click again (or forward to someone else whoclicked it), and this is a meritorious metric over which I have nocontrol. To sell it one more time, the three pleasures of the article:Swanson\\'s Style. We\\'re usually fans of Lincoln-esque simplicity, ofusing smaller words to larger effects. Swanson does do this, but oh mygoodness this kind of writing charges SAT words with a tingly, cerebralelectricity. If ever he sends you to the dictionary, the trip will onlyprove how perfectly he\\'s chosen his diction.He\\'s also a consummate smartass and we envy him for it.Showing Not Telling. Swanson does both, but in the correct order: heshows, and shows, and shows a little more before he finally tells youwhat he sees. Structurally, this is a luxury afforded only to long-formcontent (15-20 minutes here), but it allows you to understandsomething that couldn\\'t be stated outright.Sage Insight into Social Media. One can ponder social media only so longbefore wondering about the state of our souls. Swanson is way ahead ofus on this topic.By the time he defines the titular \\'anxiety of influencers\\' moredirectly, you see that The Anxiety isn\\'t really specific to influencers(or TikTok). It has afflicted all of us to whatever extent we\\'ve allowedsocial media to define personhood.Marketing Clarification \\\\u26a0\\\\ufe0f Don\\'t read the article as a broadcondemnation of influencer marketing (IM), which is a real thing forserious marketers. Think \"people in public professional niches\" and not\"teenyboppers dancing around.\"0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e39\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 INFOGRAPHIC: The 8x5 Guide to Effective Cold Emails.The given headline is very different and oddly specific: How to Writethe Perfect Email to Apply for an Unlisted Role. We suggest thealternate headline because the link\\'s value is much broader than \"advicefor attempting this specific form of professional Hail Mary.\"The information is helpful for all sorts of cold emails, and we\\'d thinkto call it the 8x5 Guide because it\\'s broken into two main pieces: the 8Essential Elements of an Effective Cold Email and 5 Ways to MaximizeYour Cold Email. The whole infographic is focused in just the right way:it frames the questions and tricky bits you\\'ll need to think about(along with a few specific pointers) so that you can figure out how todo \"the right things\" your own way.Last but not least: not only is the infographic beautifully produced,but the graphical elements actually clarify and enhance the meaning(rather than simply finding Clip Art that matches the written copy).To sample, here\\'s Essential Element \\\\u2116 1:0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e38\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 The Humor Typology Quiz.We arrived in this fun psychologicalneck of the woods by way of this interview(itself a good read)between Nir Eyal, author of the excellent Hooked, and the co-authors ofa newer book on workplace humor. But then, somewhere in there, they mentioned their above-linked HumorTypology Quiz and things officially got interesting. Sample resultsshown below (from Kevin, our Managing Editor and main writer-person).The left-right axis is Affiliative vs. Aggressive, the up-down axis isExpressive vs. Subtle, and the resulting quadrants create four differentstyles of humor. Each person\\'s sense of humor will balance out a bitdifferently. (Kevin\\'s sense of humor is 79% subtle and 59% aggressive,which seems about right for a smartass.)0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e37\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 20 Technical Skills Any Marketer Might Find Useful.Once again, we\\'veedited the headline-not as criticism, but just to help the value findits audience.The article winds up being a good summary of the specific hard skillsthat jack-of-all-trade digital marketers (like ourselves) pick up overtime, most often because specific circumstances require(d) them. On that note, just remember that the circumstances will often direct youto what you need to learn next; you don\\'t need to eat the whole whale inone sitting. You won\\'t need every single skill, and you only need truedepth of expertise in a couple of them;\\xa0that\\'s the whole T-shapedmarketerthing.Articles like the link above are useful because things will \"click\" moreand more if you at least know The First Thing about a topic.0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e36\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 INFOGRAPHIC: 15 Types of Content to Post on Social Media.This seems handy. (EDIT: Time has proven it to be. We\\'ve come back to itourselves.)It\\'s not fancy or flashy, but it\\'s good info... and soothing for itstidy simplicity. This preview should give you an idea even if it\\'s toosmall to read right here: 0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e35\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 The Demographics of 11 Major Social Networks.Demographic data isn\\'t perfect by any means, and the hipsters ofmarketing data will scoff and call it mainstream (psychographics are thenew orange, or something). Thing is... it\\'s still useful data. Demographics are a very good way to\"shorthand\" the group of people you\\'re talking about-doubly applicableto social media for business/marketing-and demographic data is oftenthe difference between a certain channel being a waste of your time or agold mine in waiting. Oh, and the data comes in two tidy charts. This is the kind of data thatdoesn\\'t quickly change about social channels, so study those charts fora few minutes if you\\'re marketing on social media.0\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e34\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 88 Conversion-Friendly Words and Phrases.We absolutely adore this infographic featured in Social Media Today, andwe also hate it a tiny bit because the \"infographic\" is really just fourlists of words, which means this is totally an infographic we could havemade (but didn\\'t). Sigh.Still, this is an excellent collection, and it\\'s sorted into fourdifferent persuasive buckets: Imply Exclusivity, Imply Scarcity, LowerRisk, and Power Words. One relevant tangent for each bucket:Implying Exclusivity. As you employ these words, you should have twogoals in mind: (A) creating a \"velvet rope\" that makes your best 20% ofcustomers feel comfortable spending more money and (B) increasing theperceived value of your brand to the other 80% of customers, pluseveryone who isn\\'t yet a customer at all.Implying Scarcity. Sometimes you should imply scarcity, but other timesyou should shout it as loudly and clearly as you can. The languageshould be gently weighted in the former case, but in the latter case,the scarcity should be something naturally-occurring as opposed tosomething you\\'ve just conjured from thin air.Lowering Risk. The words and phrases in this list definitely blunt thefeeling of risk, but it\\'s on you as the marketer to reverse the riskif you possibly can. In other words, don\\'t just stamp the rightbuzzwords onto the page; ensure the customer that YOU are assuming therisk FOR them.A money-back guarantee is risk reversal because, if it\\'s enacted bythe customer, they don\\'t incur any losses; you agree to incur lossesfor them.Power Words. It\\'s a mixture of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, butwhat they have in common is some amount of color and connotation. Thewords on this list are useful not just for their literal meaning, butalso for their emotional content.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

       " 'Plus, solving single-use plastics via SPAC | Tuesday, December 14, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By DealCloud\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 14, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Last week\\'s BuzzFeed stock mess, in which ex-employees were unable to sell their sinking shares, put a spotlight on stock transfer agents; essential capital markets players who generally prefer to remain in the shadows.Why it matters: The stock transfer industry is an oligopoly that hasn\\'t endeared itself to many of the venture capital and private equity funds whose portfolio companies rely upon it. Or, more the the point, I heard all sorts of creative obscenities yesterday when speaking with firm CFOs who normally are loath to return my calls.Market intelligence: Stock transfer used to be the domain of banks, which operated the businesses as loss leaders. Today, though, there are only a handful of major players.The largest is ComputerShare, an Australia-listed company. It\\'s followed by Continental, which seems to dominate the SPAC merger market (including the BuzzFeed deal). There\\'s also American Stock Transfer, which soon will be merged with U.K.-based Equiniti (via PE sponsor Siris Capital Group) and SRS Acquiom (which only works on private share mergers).Complaints about stock transfer agents mostly revolve around unexplained waits, mistakes and antiquated tech interfaces. All of which appears to be getting exacerbated by record deal activity, although Computershare SVP Michael Lang tells Axios that \"we\\'ve not experienced any delays.\"Following our BuzzFeed piece, I received numerous emails from people who\\'ve had maddening stock transfer agent experiences, often including lengthy email trails. Some were tied to SPACs, some to IPOs, some to post-IPO lockup expirations and some to mergers.One longtime Silicon Valley CFO tells me that the current situation is reminiscent of the dotcom boom, when share transfers could take up to two weeks to be completed. \"It\\'s not quite as bad right now,\" she says, \"but it\\'s still very, very bad.\"To be sure, stock transfer is a tough business, and SPAC mergers have added layers of complexity because of the shareholder vote and redemption processes. And most of their communication is with company lawyers — not with CEOs or investors — which only adds to the opacity.Steven Nelson, president of Continental says: “We have reviewed the entire record on the BuzzFeed deal and, while we are sensitive to the shareholders’ inability to sell before the share price sank, we feel that Continental performed appropriately and pro-actively given the timing of the records we received and the directions received from our customer and their counsel.”But I simply couldn\\'t find a single person outside of the stock transfer firms themselves who had something nice to say. And that means the industry has a big problem, and could be ripe for disruption. Kind of like we\\'ve seen a group of startups emerge around property title processing.Brian Hirsch is founder of Tribeca Venture Partners, which focuses almost exclusively on New York City startups.

A lot of that ends up floating in the world\\'s oceans, slowly breaking down into microplastics that can\\'t be found or easily filtered, while most of the rest is dumped into landfills or burned (thus adding to CO2 emissions).Details: The deal includes $460 million of PIPE financing from backers like Koch Strategic Platforms, including $150 million in Series C preferred stock to be funded immediately. Among Footprint\\'s private backers have been Olympus Partners, Cleveland Avenue, JBS, Sweetgreen and Conagra.The bottom line: \"Increased government regulation, heightened corporate sustainability efforts and changing societal preferences have been a boost to its business, with many consumer-packaged-goods companies seeking alternatives to single-use plastic.\" — Gillian Tan, Bloomberg\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Course Hero, a Redwood City, Calif.-based online learning platform, raised $380 million in Series C funding at a $3.6 billion valuation, Axios has learned.

The Flames join the Senators and Islanders as the third team this season with a postponement.🏈\\xa0NFL: A record 37 players tested positive on Monday after a weekend that saw at least a dozen other players miss games due to COVID protocols.⚽️ European soccer: At least five Premier League teams are dealing with outbreaks a week after Tottenham\\'s outbreak led the league to reinstate emergency COVID measures. Germany\\'s Bundesliga, meanwhile, is limiting crowd capacity amid rising cases.🎓\\xa0College sports: Tulane\\'s men\\'s basketball team is temporarily shutting down amid an outbreak, with all three games this week postponed.🎾\\xa0Tennis: Emma Raducanu, the reigning U.S. Open champ who last week was named WTA\\'s Newcomer of the Year, tested positive and is out of this week\\'s event in Abu Dhabi.Data: Our World in Data; Chart: Will Chase/AxiosThe big picture: When the Delta variant hit over the summer, most vaccinated arms had been freshly jabbed, but Omicron\\'s ascent comes as springtime vaccine effectiveness has begun waning.While it\\'s good news that Omicron appears to cause less severe illness than Delta, the new variant is over four times more transmissible, according to one Japanese study.An infectious disease doctor in Canada estimates Ontario will have 10,000 daily Omicron cases by Dec. 31, and predicts the Ontario government will close NBA and NHL games to fans. Between the lines: Boosters more than double effectiveness against Omicron, and leagues are taking notice: The NBA modified its definition of \"fully vaccinated\" to include the booster as of Dec. 17.The NFL will require boosters for its Tier 1 and 2 employees by Dec. 27.The bottom line: \"No one should be in any doubt,\" U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday. \"There is a tidal wave of Omicron coming.\"\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 AP All-AmericansMichigan edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

Photo: ISC Archives/CQ-Roll Call Group via Getty Images\\xa074 years ago today, the first in a series of meetings that ultimately led to the founding of NASCAR was held at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida.The backdrop: The world\\'s early-20th-century obsession with land speed records took center stage at the Daytona Beach Road Course, with 15 records set there between 1905–35.The prohibition era (1920–33), meanwhile, led to the rise of \"stock cars\" — souped-up cars used by bootleggers to outrun the police — and when prohibition ended, their natural evolution was to become race cars.In 1935, a mechanic named William France Sr., moved to Daytona Beach and in 1936, he entered the first official stock car race.The big picture: By 1938, France had taken over administration of the Road Course, and in the ensuing years realized two things: people would pay to watch these races, and more organization was needed.On Dec. 14, 1947, he gathered a group of racers and promoters who\\'d been involved in his small but successful National Championship Stock Car Circuit in hopes of creating something bigger.Two months later, NASCAR was born, and a decade after that the newly-built Daytona International Speedway hosted the inaugural Daytona 500.🎥\\xa0Watch: History of NASCAR (YouTube)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏒 NHL triviaPhoto: Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\\xa0Marc-André Fleury last week became just the third goalie in NHL history with 500 victories.Question: Who are the other two?Hint: Both have an \"O\" in their last name.Answer at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa010. 🎟 1 interactive gaming thing Source: GiphyActivate, the interactive gaming experience that went viral over the weekend, couldn\\'t possibly look like more fun.Only downside?

More details in No. 2 below.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Libya\\'s dangerous electionProtests in Tripoli against the candidacies of Khalifa Haftar (front, with X) and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (back, with X). Photo: Hamza Alahmar/Anadolu Agency via Getty.\\xa0Libya’s Dec. 24 presidential election is now all but certain to be postponed due to a dispute over who can run, raising fears that a period of relative calm will soon come to an end.Why it matters: Many feared that a rushed, winner-take-all election in the deeply divided country would spark renewed conflict. A delay carries risks of its own.The three main would-be candidates are all controversial.Khalifa Haftar, the rogue general who dominates Eastern Libya, launched a military offensive on Tripoli in 2019 that sparked renewed civil war.Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, an alleged war criminal who was rumored to be dead, has re-emerged as a potential heir to his father, dictator Muammar Gaddafi.Interim Prime Minister Abdelhamid Dabeiba has broken a vow not to run, and critics say he\\'s effectively bankrolling his campaign using state resources.Driving the news: All three have faced legal challenges to their candidacies, some of which are ongoing. As a result, the electoral commission was unable to publish the candidate list on time to hold the requisite two weeks of campaigning before Dec. 24.It remains to be seen whether the now-inevitable postponement will be days-long, indefinite, or somewhere in between. The state of play: Political factions are maneuvering to take advantage of the precarious situation, says Claudia Gazzini, Libya analyst for the International Crisis Group.Some want a delay of at least a year. Others contend Dabeiba’s mandate ends on Dec. 24 and he must be replaced. Some are still pushing to vote as soon as possible.Gazzini says “the most realistic option” is a delay of a few months in order to sort out the list of candidates, adjust the election law, and try to gather commitments to respect the result.Emadeddin Badi, a Libya expert at the Atlantic Council, contends that if an election is held under the current circumstances — with a disputed legal basis, no provisions for power-sharing and armed groups backing particular candidates  —  “it’s going to manufacture a crisis more than it’s going to solve anything.”What to watch: The potential pitfalls of the two-part elections are many.“What happens if Haftar doesn’t make it to the second round?” Gazzini asks. “Is he going to all of a sudden say, ‘OK, no problem, I’m going to recognize the results anyways?’” This is, after all, the man who just launched a civil war.“What happens if Saif al-Islam turns out to be the winner? Is everyone going to be cool and accept it as the result?” she continues.Between the lines: That potential outcome is the cause of particular concern in Washington, Badi says. Russia, he adds, is backing Saif’s candidacy.Flashback: Once the face of reform in his father’s regime, Saif became a pariah from the moment he declared — during the uprising in 2011 against his father — that thousands would die and Libya would descend into civil war if the protests continued.Now those remarks strike many Libyans as prescient, Gazzini says, and Saif appears “clean from the dirty politics of the last 10 years.”Many Libyans have grown nostalgic for the Gaddafi era after a decade of chaos.What’s next: “The definition of a dire situation or a conflict in Libya is now basically this surreal show of drones, foreigners, Syrian mercenaries, Russian mercenaries,” says Badi.“We’re bound to have some type of conflict, whether in the lead-up to elections being delayed or after the elections are delayed,” he says, but likely not on that scale for now.\\xa0\\xa02. Excerpt: The chaotic origins of the Abraham AccordsPhoto Illustration: Annelise Capossela. Photo: Chen Mengtong/China News Service via Getty Images\\xa0Axios\\' Barak Ravid spoke to nearly all of the key players involved in the secret dealmaking between Israel, the U.S. and four Arab countries to write the definitive behind-the-scenes account of the Abraham Accords.That reporting is available in our new podcast, in Barak\\'s new book (in Hebrew) and on our site (in English). Here\\'s an excerpt:A week before Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s July 1, 2020, deadline to annex parts of the West Bank, Donald Trump agreed to hold an Oval Office meeting on the topic.Why it matters: Netanyahu\\'s plans would violate international law, likely kill the two-state solution for good, and potentially destabilize the region. World leaders were scrambling to stop him. But Trump\\'s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, was pushing for annexation.Behind the scenes: Trump began the meeting in an impatient and irritable mood. He griped about a speech Netanyahu had given several months earlier during the unveiling of his Middle East peace plan (the campaign-style speech was \"inappropriate,\" Trump later said in an interview).Trump cut off Friedman\\'s annexation pitch, asking, \"Why are we talking about this?” As Friedman tried to make his case, Trump insisted he\\'d already done more for Israel than any other president.At one point, Friedman noted that there was a rift inside the Israeli government on whether to move ahead on annexation. By then, Trump had had enough.\"Mike, you decide,\" Trump said, pointing at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \"But if anything bad happens, it’s on all your heads.\"Go deeper: Read the full story.Listen to the podcast.Trump blasts Netanyahu for disloyalty: \"F**k him\".\\xa0\\xa03.

As a Taiwanese official presenting at Biden\\'s Summit of Democracy last Friday showed a slide that appeared to show Taiwan as a different country from China, the video feed was cut, Reuters reports.On the one hand: Sources told Reuters the White House cut the video because of concerns around the \"one China policy,\" under which the U.S. does not recognize Taiwan\\'s independence.On the other: The State Department said it was an \"honest mistake\" due to screen-sharing issues.2. China shipped 1 million Covid vaccines to Nicaragua after the country severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan, leaving just 13 countries recognizing the self-governing island.3. Russia today vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for climate change to be treated as a core threat to international security. India also voted \"no.\"4. Media mogul Jimmy Lai and seven other pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong were sentenced to up to 14 months in prison today for taking part in a commemoration last year of the Tiananmen Square massacre.5. Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi today offered assurances that Ugandan forces taking part in a joint operation against a rebel group would only be in the country temporarily.Flashback: \"Uganda\\'s intervention has provoked unease because of its army\\'s conduct during Congo\\'s 1998-2003 civil war, when Uganda was accused of occupying territory and plundering resources,\" Reuters notes.\\xa0\\xa0A message from The EconomistEnjoy an unmissable offer\\xa0\\xa0Enjoy 50% off an annual digital subscription in our special holiday offer.

Photo: Andrej Isakovic/AFP via Getty Images\\xa0Thousands of protesters across Serbia blocked roadways and bridges for the third consecutive weekend over the government\\'s environmental policies, including a proposal for a new lithium mine.Why it matters: These are some of the largest anti-government protests President Aleksandar Vučić\\'s government has seen in years. They come ahead of April\\'s general election. Driving the news: The protests were initially prompted by two recently adopted laws that would have paved the way for the expansion of mining projects like a new lithium mine run by Anglo-Australian company Rio Tinto.Vučić last week agreed to withdraw and amend the controversial laws and allow for more debate on the Rio Tinto project.Yes, but: There\\'s suspicion among the activists that the government is only seeking to stall until the elections are over, says Srđan Cvijić, a senior policy analyst at the Open Society Foundation.Between the lines: While Serbia is no stranger to mass protests, the latest wave of demonstrations has united a wide spectrum of opposition and civil society groups.Activist Savo Manojlović summed it up: \"Protests for all. Leftists bothered by right-wingers can put up a blockade at a different location. ...

Haiti: A motive to kill a presidentOfficials attend Moïse\\'s funeral in July.

Why it matters: The late president\\'s wife, Martine Moïse, told Abi-Habib that gunmen rifled through her husband\\'s files during the attack as she laid wounded on the floor. Some of the alleged hit men have told investigators they were instructed to find the list.“I would be a fool to think that narco-trafficking and arms trafficking didn’t play a role in the assassination,” Daniel Foote who was until recently the U.S. special envoy to Haiti, told The Times. “Anyone who understands Haiti’s politics or economics understands this.”Many of those who feared exposure by Moïse were his former allies in the country\\'s business and political elite.The investigation into the assassination has stalled. One line that hit hard: “The true leader wasn’t the president,” said Gabriel Fortuné, a close adviser to Mr. Moïse who died in an earthquake a day after speaking with The Times. “It was his godfather, [former president Michel] Martelly.Go deeper: Read The NYT investigation\\xa0\\xa06.

       " 'Plus, SenseTime delays its IPO. | Monday, December 13, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By DealCloud\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 13, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Private equity funds should incentivize larger numbers of portfolio company employees, because it will better align interests and improve investment performance.Sure, I\\'ve been writing that for years. But now it\\'s also being said by ... (checks notes) limited partners in private equity funds.Driving the news: Coller Capital this morning released its biannual \"Private Equity Barometer\" survey of more than 100 global LPs. Its lead finding was that 46% of respondents believe the likely effect of incentivizing more portfolio company employees would be to increase returns. Only 6% said they believe it would decrease returns. The rest didn\\'t know.It\\'s worth emphasizing that these LPs are true believers in the private equity model, with a whopping 89% saying that small and mid-cap companies would benefit from at least a period of PE ownership.This isn\\'t a novel idea. KKR, for example, for several years has provided equity incentives to rank-and-file in some of its industrials companies (and has sought to expand the practice). Other firms have begun to selectivity follow in its footsteps. The basic argument is that it\\'s good business, because it improves employee morale and reduces turnover. It\\'s also good PR in an ESG-obsessed world, and could help seal new deals with company founders who are interested in their employees\\' future wellbeing. The bottom line: Limited partners pay the private equity bills. If they truly believe employees are vital stakeholders, and should be treated as such, it\\'s time to share those convictions directly with general partners during the fundraising process. Surveys are a start, but not an end.Quasi-related breaking news: Coller Capital is on the block, per Reuters.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0SenseTime, a Chinese developer of facial recognition technology, is delaying its Hong Kong IPO after being added to a U.S. Treasury Department blacklist of \"Chinese military-industrial companies.\"Why it\\'s the BFD: This is China\\'s most highly valued AI company, fetching a $13 billion mark after being placed on a different U.S. government blacklist for its alleged involvement in human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. That original designation prevented SenseTime from doing business with U.S. companies, whereas the new one prevents U.S. investors from buying or selling its listed shares. U.S. investors in SenseTime include Fidelity, Glade Brook, Qualcomm Ventures and Silver Lake. Other backers include Alibaba, SoftBank and Primavera Capital Group. The company originally planned to raise $2 billion in its IPO, but later cut its target back to $767 million.The bottom line: SenseTime says the U.S. accusation are \"unfounded\" and that the delay is designed to let it update its prospectus. Retail investors who already subscribed to the IPO, which was expected to price this Friday, will have their fees, interest and other costs refunded.\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Snaplogic, a San Mateo, Calif.-based enterprise data integration platform, raised $165 million at a $1 billion valuation.

Welcome back.Today\\'s word count: 1,602 words (6 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏁 Formula 1\\'s wild finaleMax Verstappen celebrating with his Red Bull Racing team. Photo: Joe Portlock/Formula 1 via Getty Images\\xa0The Formula 1 title was decided amid controversy on the final lap Sunday — a fitting end to one of the most dramatic seasons ever.Driving the news: Max Verstappen claimed his first F1 world championship by overtaking rival Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.Verstappen is the first Dutch champion in the sport\\'s 71-year history, the fourth-youngest champion, and the first Red Bull driver to win a title since Sebastian Vettel in 2013.His victory snapped a run of four straight titles for Hamilton, who\\'s still searching for a record eighth championship, which would move him past Michael Schumacher.Data: Formula 1; Table: Thomas Oide/Axios The controversy: Verstappen appeared to have lost out to Hamilton, until a crash by Nicholas Latifi triggered a safety car on Lap 52 of 58.Race director Michael Masi initially decided the five lapped cars between first-place Hamilton and second-place Verstappen would remain in place and not be able to overtake the safety car.But in a surprising twist, Masi changed his decision and told lapped cars they could pass the safety car, putting Verstappen directly behind Hamilton for a one-lap dash to the finish. Thanks to fresher tires (he had pitted during the safety car laps) and not having to maneuver around traffic, Verstappen overtook Hamilton (who had not pitted) and won the race.What they\\'re saying: In the wake of Verstappen\\'s victory, much of the attention was on Mercedes protesting the outcome. Not exactly the way you want to end a thrilling year-long duel.\"I don\\'t think Masi was trying to favor one driver or the other. ... But [his decision] leaves him wide open to criticism [and] that\\'s just such a sad way for this year to end,\" writes Racer\\'s Chris Medland.\"This wasn\\'t a referee swallowing the whistle, this was a referee taking a match to the rulebook ... and shrugging his shoulders when questioned,\" writes The Athletic\\'s Jordan Bianchi (subscription).The bottom line: Sunday\\'s thrilling racing drama and complex rules controversy would make for a great reality show — which is exactly what we\\'ll get when the next season of Netflix\\'s \"Drive to Survive\" comes out.🎥\\xa0Watch: The full final lap (Twitter)\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL Sunday: Brady beats the Bills (again)Photo: Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\\xa0Tom Brady delivered a walk-off TD to lift the Bucs past the Bills, 33-27 (OT), and cap a banner Sunday for the 44-year-old MVP favorite.He passed Drew Brees for most completions in NFL history (7,156), improved to 33-3 against the Bills, and secured the 19th 10-win season of his incredible career.He also added a rushing touchdown, tying Jerry Rice for most TD scored after age 40. No record is safe.Elsewhere:Rodgers owns the Bears: Speaking of dominating an opponent, Aaron Rodgers tossed four TD and improved to 22-5 against the Bears. His QB ratings in his last four games against them: 147.9, 132.3, 128.0, 141.1.RIP, Demaryius: The Broncos honored Demaryius Thomas in almost every way on Sunday. They began with 10 men on offense and took a delay of game penalty, which the Lions declined.KC looks dangerous: The Chiefs destroyed the Raiders, 48-9, to tie the Patriots and Titans atop the AFC at 9-4. Their suddenly-dominant defense has allowed 16 first-half points in the last three games.Hollywood Herbert: Justin Herbert (23/31, 275 yds, 3 TD) lit up the Giants (did you see this pass?!) and joined Dan Marino as the only QBs in NFL history with 60 passing TD through two seasons.Baltimore\\'s injury bug: The Ravens lost Lamar Jackson to a sprained ankle, the latest injury in a season plagued by them. Despite placing 23 players on IR, they\\'re still clinging to the No. 4 seed in the AFC.Jags disaster: The Titans shutout the Jaguars, who are 2-11 and spiraling amid more Urban Meyer drama.

But the companies — and countries — that figure out quantum will take the lead in a new era of computing.What\\'s happening: Quantum computers — which harness the weird and difficult physics of the quantum world — have experienced a number of notable improvements in recent weeks.In November, IBM unveiled its Eagle quantum processor, which packs 127 qubits — the quantum equivalent of the bits that drive classical computing — making it the first to break the 100-qubit barrier.This week, Quantinuum — a new quantum computing company created by the merger of software maker Cambridge Quantum and hardware manufacturer Honeywell Quantum Solutions — announced the world\\'s first commercial product created solely by a quantum computer: a powerful encryption key generator.On Dec. 8, quantum computer maker IonQ — one of the few companies in the space to go public — announced plans to use barium ions as qubits in its systems, which president and CEO Peter Chapman says will improve the stability and reliability of its quantum computers.By the numbers: The global quantum computing market is currently valued at $490 million, with 21.9% annual growth, and is projected to be worth nearly $1 billion by 2024, according to Bob Sorensen, chief analyst for quantum computing at Hyperion Research.\"Hardware is hard, and it takes time for the engineering to advance from fundamental devices to useful devices,\" said William Oliver, director of the Center for Quantum Engineering at MIT, at this week\\'s Q2B Practical Quantum Computing Conference. \"But that is happening as quantum transitions from lab curiosity to technical reality.\"How it works: Classical computers, from the smallest device to the most powerful supercomputer, do their calculations through the binary manipulation of bits, which can be in only two states: on or off, 1 or 0.Quantum computers use the quantum state of an object to produce qubits. The complex math behind these qubits can be plugged into special algorithms to do calculations that would be practically impossible for a classical computer to perform — a quality known as quantum advantage or supremacy.A working quantum computer could theoretically break the internet\\'s most secure cryptography, solve impossibly complex logistical and optimization challenges, or simulate matter and chemistry on an incredibly precise scale.The catch: More qubits should mean more powerful quantum computers, which is why hardware makers frequently tout the qubit totals on their latest models. For the machines to do useful work, they need to keep those qubits in a particular quantum state called a superposition as long as possible.But qubits are \"highly sensitive,\" says IBM\\'\\'s Jerry Chow, and slight variations of temperature or vibrations can cause them to lose their quantum state in a process called decoherence, turning qubits into boring old bits.Oliver compared the current state of quantum computers to the Wright Brothers\\' first plane. \"It was a key milestone in flight,\" he said, \"but it wasn\\'t like the next day we all went out and bought airplane tickets.\"Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. Running the international quantum raceVisitors look at an Alibaba quantum computer at a conference in Hangzhou, China, in October. Photo: Long Wei/VCG via Getty Images\\xa0The race for quantum supremacy isn\\'t just between tech companies, but between nation-states as well.Why it matters: The first country to produce effective, working quantum computers will have a key advantage in economics, defense and cybersecurity — and the U.S., China, and Europe are all competing. What\\'s happening: Last month, the Commerce Department added a dozen Chinese companies to a trade blacklist in an effort to prevent emerging U.S. technologies from being used for quantum computing efforts that would boost Beijing\\'s military. \"The United States is quite a ways ahead in many areas [of quantum] and we have a lot of talent,\" says Laura Thomas, a former CIA case officer and the director of national security solutions for ColdQuanta. \"But China is catching up in closing that gap very quickly,\" she says.The big picture: One of the clearest uses of quantum computing is to eventually break the complex mathematical problems used to encrypt information of all kinds on the internet, including sensitive government data.That\\'s not yet possible with today\\'s quantum computers, but it could well be within a decade or less. In the meantime, nations are likely intercepting and storing data now with the expectation that they\\'ll be able to decrypt it in the future. Between the lines: While U.S. companies generally have the lead on building better quantum computers, China has invested massively in the industry, including an $11 billion national laboratory for quantum information sciences.Chinese researchers have made breakthroughs on quantum communications, including via satellite, and Chinese companies dominate patent applications for quantum cryptography.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa03. Charting an ethical path for quantum computingIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0As quantum computing matures, industry experts are calling for ethics to be taken into account as early as possible.Why it matters: Previous technological development in social media and AI took place before their makers fully grappled with the ethical considerations.  The early stage of quantum computing means there\\'s still time to better shape its development.What\\'s happening: From total decryption to more powerful AI, quantum computing could eventually affect nearly every corner of life — which is why now is the time to think about what the technology should and shouldn\\'t do, experts say.Earlier this year, a group of quantum computing insiders released a video meant to raise awareness about the ethical questions that society will face in the coming quantum age.Quantum computers could superpower AI, potentially worsening the negative effects of that technology, while quantum algorithms could help financial firms game the market, increasing income inequality.\"Like any technology, it can be used as a force for good and it can also be used as a force for not so good,\" said Ilana Wisby, CEO of Oxford Quantum Circuits, in the video.Between the lines: The fact that quantum computing is still in such an early stage of development means that its potentially negative effects could be forestalled before they impact large groups of people.One way is to ensure that — unlike many earlier technological leaps — is involving a more diverse group of people in actually designing quantum computing, says Eliška Greplová, a quantum expert at the Delft University of Technology.The catch: While the overall quantum workforce is still tiny — giving it room to diversify as it grows — women and Black and Hispanic students are highly underrepresented in quantum-related disciplines like physics and computer sciences.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsCharter is #1 in rural internet service\\xa0\\xa0We’re proud to announce that Spectrum Internet ranks No. 1 in the U.S. News & World Report 2021-22 “Best Rural Internet Service Providers” rankings.

An AI can inspire intimacy (with a little human help)Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0The AI startup Primer has harnessed a natural language processing (NLP) model to generate conversation-provoking questions for team building.Why it matters: The exercise shows how AI, properly trained by experts, can \"help humans be more humans,\" as Primer director of science John Bohannon puts it.But it also illustrates the very human work that still needs to be done to ensure such models produce meaningful content.How it works: Bohannon first wrote a numbered list of some 20 example deep talk questions — such as \"What animal would you be for a day?\" — and then fed those prompts into a language model called GPT-J-6B, a smaller, open-source version of OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 text-generating system.In just a few seconds, the model took those training prompts and began spitting out deep talk questions in the same style — hundreds of them.In the end, Bohannon had 365 deep talk questions — like \"What do you think of when you think of Earth?\" or \"What is the difference between loving and being loved?\" — that he considered good enough to use with his team.\"I got my 365 questions, and it did it vastly faster and better than I could have done it on my own,\" says Bohannon. \"It came up with stuff I never would have thought of.\"The catch: While what he calls “Deep Talk” was easier than writing his own 365 questions, Bohannon still had to shape the right prompts and manually select the final questions from the ones generated by the model, discarding questions that were repetitive or, in his words, \"not safe for work.\"Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa05.

Photo: Johannes Schmitt-Tegge/Picture Alliance via Getty Images\\xa011.2 million juvenile oysters have been added to New York Harbor over the past six months, part of a large-scale habitat restoration.Why it matters: The oysters are a sign of a steady return to life for the long-polluted waterway and a reminder that environmental progress can and is being made even under the shadow of climate change.What\\'s happening: The restoration is part of the Billion Oyster Project, a nonprofit that aims to add the bivalves in an effort to fully clean up New York Harbor.The young oysters are attached to subtidal habitats, including mesh cages, and dropped in a section of the Hudson River off lower Manhattan.Altogether, 75 million oysters have been added to the harbor since Billion Oyster Project began in 2014.How it works: Though the oysters can\\'t be eaten — the waters are still too polluted — they actively filter the water, create marine habitats for other species, and may eventually help protect the city\\'s shoreline from storm surges.Background: Local oysters were long a staple in New York, which was known as \"the Big Oyster\" before it became \"the Big Apple,\" as author Mark Kurlansky wrote in his 2006 book. But over-harvesting reduced oyster numbers and industrial pollution eventually left the harbor inhospitable to oysters and most other marine life until cleanup and restoration efforts began.The bottom line: Environmental news can feel unremittingly grim, but the sight of fresh oysters in New York Harbor shows us that some things do get better.Which is a good thing to remember for the future.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsCharter is #1 in rural internet service\\xa0\\xa0We’re proud to announce that Spectrum Internet ranks No. 1 in the U.S. News & World Report 2021-22 “Best Rural Internet Service Providers” rankings.

       " 'Plus: Upping SEC scrutiny | Saturday, December 11, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Latham & Watkins\\xa0Axios Pro RataByKia Kokalitcheva·Dec 11, 2021Welcome back. Today we\\'re all about SPACs.Feel free to send me tips or comments by replying to this email or on Twitter @imkialikethecar.Today’s Smart Brevity™ count is 998 words ... 4 minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: SPAC merger troubles get worse Illustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0There\\'s been an uptick in cancellations of special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) mergers, with three since Thanksgiving and eight since the beginning of Q4.Why it matters: After the SPAC euphoria of 2020 and early 2021, the market is continuing its reverse trip to Earth.Driving the news: FAST Acquisition Corp. and Fertitta Entertainment canceled their merger on Friday, as did Pathfinder Acquisition Corp. and ServiceMax earlier this week.Other high-profile combinations that have fallen through this quarter include Northern Star Investment Corp. II and Apex Fintech Solutions, and Valo Health and Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. By the numbers: There were seven terminations for all of Q3, none in Q2, one in Q1 and seven in all of 2020, per SPAC Research. As of Thursday, there have also been three recut deals and 10 minimum cash restructurings in Q4.Between the lines: Deal terminations are a lagging indicator, says SPAC Research founder Ben Kwasnick.  The increase can be traced in part to a recent wave of merger close deadlines, pushing the parties to either consummate or walk away. Many are citing “market conditions” as the reason for walking away, which makes sense given the rise in stock redemptions that began this summer. If a SPAC is now trading below $10 and redemptions mean there’s no longer enough cash in trust to meet the deal’s requirements, the target may opt out.     Or if the parties don’t think the initial valuation will be supported by investors, the target company may decide it’s better to remain private for now. Yes, but: There are always outliers. BuzzFeed, for example, went ahead with the merger despite a 94% redemption level. Conversely, the Wynn Interactive and Austerlitz Acquisition Corp. I cancellation was a surprise. “Gaming is hot, gaming remains desirable, top quality sponsor … I definitely didn’t expect that one to fall apart,” says Kwasnick. The intrigue: Deal terminations are still in line with the overall level of SPAC activity. There were 121 live deals at the beginning of this quarter and 150 at the beginning of Q3 — many times more than any quarter since the start of 2019. But Kwasnick expects that to change.Also: “It’s interesting that IPOs are still getting done, lots of them,” he adds. “The market has found an equilibrium with IPOs ... if you just overfund the trust account, shareholders will back anything — but that phenomenon is expensive for sponsors because the overfunding comes from their pockets.” So it’s unclear how long that will last. The bottom line: We might be past the “anything goes” SPAC era. \\xa0\\xa02. Clouds darken on the HillIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0The SEC is ramping up its scrutiny of SPACs. Chairman Gary Gensler revealed on Thursday that he’s asked his staff to propose ways to increase the information provided to investors by reviewing disclosure requirements, marketing practices, and liability for SPAC insiders like sponsors and bankers.Why it matters: Gensler made it clear he wants his agency to be active in reigning in threats to orderly markets. What he\\'s saying: \"Functionally, the SPAC target IPO is akin to a traditional IPO. Thus, investors deserve the protections they receive from traditional IPOs,\" said Gensler. \"I think that these innovations around SPAC target IPOs remind us that there may be room for improvements in traditional IPOs as well. Broadly, though, the \\'33 Act protections have stood the test of time.\" Between the lines: \"SPAC target IPOs often are announced with a slide deck, a press release, and even celebrity endorsements. The value of SPAC shares can move dramatically based on incomplete information, long before a full disclosure document or proxy is filed,\" he said on Thursday. One example: The announcement of Donald Trump\\'s media company merging with a SPAC is a case where nearly nothing about the business was known (and much remains unknown). The SEC is investigating the deal. Flashback: Gensler is on record about potential problems with SPACs since at least May, and the vehicles have been on the SEC\\'s Agency Rule List since June.Last April, the agency\\'s corporation finance division issued guidance on warrants accounting, briefly chilling the formation of new SPACs. Meanwhile, the SPAC industry has been getting its ducks in a row in Washington as well. A group of market participants formed the SPAC Association back in May, hiring the Vogel Group and Van Heuvelen Strategies to lobby on its behalf, per Politico. The Vogel Group formally registered to represent the association this week, per federal filings. \\xa0\\xa03. Europe\\'s ambitionsIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0The U.S. has been at the center of the SPAC activity over the past two years, but Europe is working to catch up, albeit unevenly. Driving the news: This week, the duo behind Pegasus Acquisition Company Europe — \\u200b\\u200bFrench billionaire Bernard Arnault and former UniCredit head Jean Pierre Mustier—announced a second SPAC that will also list in Amsterdam. It will seek to raise 200 million euros ($226 million). The big picture: After the American SPAC boom spilled into Europe at the beginning of the year, local SPAC activity dried up at the start of the second half. Since then, it’s picked up again, and more than 30 SPACs have gone public on European exchanges. Amsterdam is the top listing destination right now, with Frankfurt coming in second. However, the U.K. is hoping to catch up after revising its safe harbor rules to be friendlier to SPACs and more in line with U.S. regulations. What to watch: How well European-listed SPACs can attract local target companies that could otherwise merge with American SPACs.  \\xa0\\xa0A message from Latham & WatkinsYou should always be preparing for an exit\\xa0\\xa0Many growth company founders and early shareholders hit a snag at just the wrong time — as they get ready to sell.One reason: They fail to consider buyer sensitivities.Hear from Latham & Watkins partner Scott Craig on how to plan ahead.

       " 'Plus, saying goodbye to Tyson Clark | Friday, December 10, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Latham & Watkins\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 10, 2021🚨 Situational awareness: The core Consumer Price Index rose 0.5% in November, while overall CPI rose 0.8%. The core CPI increase year-over-year is 4.9%, which it the highest since 1991, while the annual CPI increase is the fastest since 1982.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Many early BuzzFeed employees remain unable to sell their shares, even though the company went public this past Monday.Why it matters: BuzzFeed stock has fallen more than 40%, and so far the company has given no indication that it plans to compensate its former employees for their accelerating losses.What to know: This is not about a lock-up agreement, which applies to top company executives and current employees who have vested and exercised stock options (the company moved to RSUs in 2017). This is an administrative blunder for former employees who were told their shares would not be locked up.Axios has reviewed email correspondence between BuzzFeed and former employees with vested and exercised options, some of which was first reported on earlier this week by Insider. It\\'s also worth noting that some ex-employees tell us they didn\\'t receive all of the emails.On Nov. 23, the company wrote: \"At this moment in time you don’t have to do anything,\" and said the company would be in touch shortly about next steps.The following day, employees received requests for documentation from Continental, the stock transfer agent hired by BuzzFeed. But nothing from BuzzFeed itself; that correspondence didn\\'t come until last Wednesday night (Dec. 1). The Dec. 1 email says that the stock transfer process would take three to five business days. That means if a holder filled out the paperwork immediately, they still wouldn\\'t have had access to their stock when it began trading on Monday morning.Such a delay did not apply to other early BuzzFeed shareholders, like venture capitalists, but it isn\\'t unheard of. The big hiccup here is that there was an extra paperwork step that ex-employees weren\\'t told about until after shares began trading. Some received correspondence late Monday night (Dec. 6) from Continental, while some learned about it from BuzzFeed on Tuesday afternoon (Dec. 7). The Continental email again talked about an additional 3-5 trading days to process the new paperwork.Some BuzzFeed employees who responded immediately to Continental may have managed to sell shares. Others, including some who waited for BuzzFeed\\'s instructions, have not.In its Tuesday email, BuzzFeed blamed Continental for the mix-up, and told ex-employees that: \"We understand and sympathize with your frustration with this process.\" It did not, and has not, apologized.The situation is exacerbated by the steep price drop, and a stock conversion ratio that already has caused some early employees to be underwater (including those who worked at BuzzFeed before it became a \"unicorn\").Axios called and emailed Continental, but was unable to get in touch with anyone there (the phone call involved \"longer than usual wait times.\"). A BuzzFeed spokesperson declined to comment.BuzzFeed shares opened mostly flat this morning at $5.87 per share.The bottom line: Startup stock options are about aligning interests between the company and employees, for better or for worse. A show of good faith by both sides. In the case of BuzzFeed, that faith has been broken.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Inrupt, a Boston-based Internet user data control platform, raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Forte Ventures, per TechCrunch.Why it\\'s the BFD: Inrupt was co-founded by Tim Berners-Lee, who\\'s known as the father of the World Wide Web.Other investors include Allstate, Minderoo Foundation and insiders Akamai and Glasswing Ventures. The bottom line: \"Berners-Lee aims to fix some of the problems that have handicapped the so-called open web in an age of huge, closed platforms such as Facebook. Building on ideas developed by an open-source software project called Solid, Inrupt promises a web where people can use a single sign-on for any service and personal data is stored in pods, or personal online data stores, controlled by the user.\" — Jonathan Weber, Reuters\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Flink, a German instant grocery delivery startup, raised $750 million in Series B funding at a $2.85 billion post-money valuation.

They\\'d rather beable to say that they were working \"off the cuff\" in their brightestmoments, that they were using their wit and not their grit.UPDATE from EDITOR: The third one is actually not a scientific point. Itis very much an anecdotal point. But there you have it either way.1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e35\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Think Email Marketing is Dead?

You made it.Today\\'s word count: 1,986 words (8 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏈 No more gimmesData: Football Reference; Chart: Kavya Beheraj/AxiosNFL kickers are making 92.4% of their extra points attempts this season, the lowest mark since 1979, when they made 91.3%.The backdrop: The NFL moved extra points back by 13 yards in 2015 (two-yard line to 15-yard line), turning what had been a sure thing (99.3% success rate in 2014) into much less of one (94.2% a year later).The 2015 drop-off was nearly identical to the one kickers experienced in 1974, when the NFL moved extra points back by 10 yards (the front of the end zone to the back).Yes, but: By the 1980s, kickers had adjusted to the change and began to improve. That\\'s not happening this time around, as the success rate continues to drop.1973-80: Success rate fell from 97.7% to 92.1% (-5.6%) in the first season following the 10-yard change. Six years later, it was back up to 94.9% (-2.8% from 1973) and on the verge of a steady climb to 99%+.1973: 97.7%1974: 92.1%1975: 91.4%1976: 90.9%1977: 91.9%1978: 93.1%1979: 91.3%1980: 94.9%2014-21: Success rate fell from 99.3% to 94.2% (-5.1%) in the first season following the 13-yard change. Six years later, it\\'s down even further to 92.4% (-6.9% from 2015) and trending in the wrong direction.2014: 99.3%2015: 94.2%2016: 93.6%2017: 94%2018: 94.3%2019: 93.9%2020: 93%2021: 92.4%State of play: Five teams are under 85% on extra points this season (Texans, Jaguars, Chargers, Saints, Jets), while five are perfect (Bills, Eagles, Ravens, Falcons, Giants).The big picture: Kickers\\' lack of success on extra points has led to an increase in two-point attempts, which could ultimately make the NFL more exciting, notes PFT\\'s Michael David Smith:Perhaps coaches are starting to recognize that the extra point kick is no gimme, and that if they\\'re on the fence between kicking and going for two, they should go for two ... [Which] is a much more exciting play than the extra point.\\xa0\\xa02. 🍿 Showtime Lakers series gets title, teaser Courtesy: HBOHBO Max\\'s upcoming series about the 1980s \"Showtime\" Lakers doesn\\'t air until March, but it\\'s already causing drama, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Driving the news: The series — based on Jeff Pearlman\\'s 2014 book, \"Showtime\" — released its first trailer on Thursday, a day after announcing the title: \"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.\"\"Winning time\" is what Magic Johnson called the final minutes of close games, when he felt his team shouldn\\'t lose on mental mistakes.The cast has established stars like John C. Reilly (Jerry Buss) and Adrien Brody (Pat Riley), plus newcomers like Quincy Isaiah as Johnson (above) and DeVaughn Nixon as his father, Norm. Courtesy: HBOThe backdrop: The drama began last week, when Vanity Fair published a profile of \"Winning Time\" creator, Adam McKay (\"Succession,\" \"The Big Short\").McKay and longtime partner Will Ferrell\\'s production company split in 2019 as they pursued different types of projects. Then they stopped talking entirely, and it turns out \"Winning Time\" was the reason.Ferrell wanted to be cast as Buss, but McKay didn\\'t think he was the right fit and instead chose Ferrell\\'s best friend, Reilly. When Ferrell found out (from Reilly, not McKay), their personal relationship soured. Courtesy: HBOThe big picture: As word has gotten around from those who\\'ve seen the apparently raunchy pilot, the drama has only built.The Buss family and NBA reportedly hate the series, with its misogyny and drug use making it feel like \"a fictionalized \\'80s version of\\xa0\\'Entourage\\'\\xa0or\\xa0\\'Ballers,\\'\" per Puck\\'s Matthew Belloni (subscription).Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played for the Showtime Lakers, thinks the story would be \"best told by those who actually lived through it.\"Deborah Morales, his longtime manager, was more blunt, telling Belloni: \"I certainly hope I never bump into anyone associated with this show.\"The bottom line: From a pure entertainment standpoint, this has all the makings of a hit. And any controversy ahead of the premiere will almost certainly mean more, not fewer, eyeballs.\\xa0\\xa03. 🇨🇳 Most Americans support Beijing boycottData: Morning Consult; Chart: Jacque Schrag/AxiosMost Americans support some form of boycott against the Beijing Olympics, per a recent Morning Consult survey, Jeff writes.55% of the 2,201 respondents said either a diplomatic (31%) or total boycott (24%) would be an appropriate response given the Chinese government\\'s record of human rights violations.Just 12% opposed any form of boycott.Driving the news: President Biden on Monday announced the U.S. will engage in a diplomatic boycott. On Wednesday, the U.K., Australia, Canada and Lithuania followed suit.In a diplomatic boycott, government officials don\\'t travel to the Olympics, but athletes still compete under their flag.In response, Chinese foreign minister Zhao Lijian promised \"resolute countermeasures,\" saying, \"The United States will pay a price for its mistaken acts.\"The big picture: These are the seventh Olympics in which at least one nation will boycott, joining Melbourne 1956, Tokyo 1964, Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980, Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988.President Obama, along with Vice President Biden and first lady Michelle Obama, didn\\'t attend the Sochi Games in 2014 — likely as a rebuke to Russia\\'s anti-gay laws — but it wasn\\'t an official boycott.U.S. athletes will awkwardly field questions about China during the Games, and as WSJ notes (subscription), \"satisfy nobody, no matter how they answer.\"Go deeper: A diplomatic boycott is a start; sponsors should act next (NYT)\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosThe biggest video game news delivered to your inbox\\xa0\\xa0Get the latest scoops, trends and news from the world of video games with Axios Gaming, written by Stephen Totilo and Megan Farokhmanesh, delivered every weekday to your inbox.Why it matters: A crucial view into an industry that is an essential part of millions of people’s lives.Subscribe for free\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0🎮 Video game news: EA Sports is aiming to launch its new college football video game in the summer of 2023. ...

Subscribe.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: “Democracies vs. China” won’t cut itSarah Grillo/Axios. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images     \\xa0President Biden has described the global competition between the U.S. and China as a battle of democracy vs. autocracy. The reality is often murkier.Why it matters: Addressing the Summit for Democracy today, Biden called the erosion of democracy around the world “the defining challenge of our time.” But his democracy agenda is beginning to collide with his China strategy in uncomfortable ways.The big picture: The Biden administration has embraced Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a crucial ally in countering China while tiptoeing around his government\\'s human rights violations and democratic backsliding.It’s courting non-democracies like Vietnam and Thailand due to their strategic importance vis-à-vis China. And the administration\\'s efforts to convince the kleptocratic leaders of Equatorial Guinea not to grant China a military foothold, as revealed in the WSJ, underscore the tension between Biden\\'s desire to crack down on corrupt regimes and the need to keep them out of Beijing\\'s orbit.Reality check: “If we only dealt with perfect democracies, we couldn’t even deal with ourselves,” notes Lisa Curtis, who helped craft the Trump administration’s China strategy and now heads the Indo-Pacific security program at the Center for a New American Security.Biden has also had some success in syncing up with fellow democracies when it comes to China, particularly on human rights issues.Still, hopes that this week\\'s summit might be a stepping stone toward an \"alliance of democracies\" may be tempered by the difficulties of determining who exactly would attend it.This tension between interests and values in America\\'s global partnerships is nothing new.As the U.S. was pitching democracy to the world during the Cold War, some of its more reliable partners were autocrats. Even within NATO, not all of the original allies were democracies, notes Yale University historian John Lewis Gaddis. Indeed, the U.S. was building those alliances during the Jim Crow era at home.Gaddis contends that one lesson from the Cold War is that in its relationships with countries like Thailand — which Secretary of State Tony Blinken will visit next week, and where a military junta took power in 2014 — the U.S. priority should be the balance of power in Asia, rather than influencing domestic politics.“You’re going to have to make compromises on principles to get to that point. That’s what strategy is all about,” Gaddis says.Flashback: Biden aides contend they can do both at once. I asked Blinken\\'s deputy, Wendy Sherman, earlier this year how she squared her outreach to Cambodia and Thailand (which she was visiting at the time) with Biden\\'s democracy agenda. \"One has to raise it all,” she said. “If I go to a country in which we have a security relationship, that\\'s important, but it doesn\\'t stop us from raising these human rights issues.”Zoom in: Curtis points to another country of major importance in the U.S.-China competition, both because of its location just off of India and because of China’s growing investments and influence: Sri Lanka, where the ruling Rajapaksa brothers have been trampling democratic institutions. That\\'s one of many such cases where the U.S. will have to decide whether to court unsavory governments to compete for influence or to keep them at arm\\'s length.“This is an example of how you weigh your policies and try to compete, to remain in the game but at the same time continue to stand up for your principles,” Curtis said.The bottom line: Biden sees defending democracy and outcompeting China as the central challenges of the 21st century, but they won\\'t always be perfectly aligned.\\xa0\\xa02. Democracy summit kicks offPhoto: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty\\xa0Roughly half the world was invited to Biden’s Summit for Democracy — including some strategically important countries with weak democracies (the Philippines, Pakistan), and excluding a few countries (Bolivia, Sierra Leone) that may have had a decent case for inclusion.Driving the news: The Chinese government objected loudly, particularly because Taiwan was invited. Beijing held an alternative summit, issued a joint op-ed with Russia denouncing Biden’s “Cold-War mentality,” and launched a PR campaign calling China “a democracy that works.”Pakistan turned down its invitation, a decision that was no doubt influenced by its close relationship with Beijing.Hungary, the only EU country excluded from the summit, tried unsuccessfully to prevent European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen from speaking. State of play: Biden\\'s campaign promise to hold the summit turned into a logistical headache for his administration, which has scrambled to assuage concerns about the guest list or claims the U.S. is in no position to lecture the world on democracy. Biden himself began his address with an acknowledgment of the “ongoing struggle to live up to our highest ideals.”What’s next: As the virtual summit continues tomorrow, Biden is expected to roll out new sanctions on individuals for undermining democracy and encourage other countries to follow suit.Worth noting: Global opposition leaders and activists have also been invited to speak. Those include Venezuela’s Juan Guaidó, whose position as the country’s opposition leader is in growing jeopardy.\\xa0\\xa03.

Photo: Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images\\xa0Biden spoke for 90 minutes today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he continued to brief European allies on Tuesday\\'s call with Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin.Driving the news: White House officials\\' briefing reports on the call rejected speculation that Biden would pressure Ukraine to cede territory to Russian-backed separatists in order to deter Putin from launching a large-scale invasion, Axios\\' Zach Basu reports.Biden also stressed there would be \"no decisions or discussions about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" according to a White House readout. Behind the scenes: Biden reassured Zelensky during their call that Russia has no veto right over Ukraine\\'s possible accession to NATO, an adviser to Zelensky told Axios.Zelensky said that he was happy to enter discussions over the implementation of the 2014 Minsk Protocol, but that there could be no detailed negotiations without a genuine ceasefire and the restoration of Ukraine\\'s sovereignty, the adviser said.Moving forward, Zelensky would like to see Biden implement sanctions now that could be rolled back if Russia de-escalates, and fulfill remaining requests for military equipment that were submitted based on U.S. intelligence of the current Russian threat, according to the adviser.Both the U.S. and Ukrainian sides characterized the call as open, warm and friendly.Biden also held a call with the leaders of nine eastern flank NATO allies — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia — in order to reassure them of the U.S. commitment to collective defense, per a senior administration official.\\xa0\\xa05.

The \"green colonialism\" debateIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Averting the worst effects of climate change will eventually require the entire world to get off carbon, but some critics allege richer countries are trying to halt fossil fuels in poorer countries while continuing to drill at home, Axios Future correspondent Bryan Walsh writes.Why it matters: New policies that aim to restrict fossil fuel development in poorer countries in the name of climate change are on a collision course with those nations\\' need for energy-fueled growth and development.What\\'s happening: At the United Nations climate conference earlier this year, the U.S., U.K. and other countries promised to end international financing for fossil fuel development.The catch: To some critics, however, the promise smacked of \"green colonialism,\" as rich nations preemptively cut off desperately poor countries from the cheap fossil fuels that helped make them rich in the first place.In effect, they seem to be exporting the hard political choices around climate change away from their own citizens — and voters — to those who can least afford it.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa07.

       " 'Plus, Lee crumples up Alden\\'s hostile takeover bid. | Thursday, December 09, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Latham & Watkins\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 09, 2021🚨 Some news: Our upcoming Axios Pro newsletter on fintech deals will be co-authored by Ryan Lawler and Lucinda Shen.Ryan is known to many of you for his work at TechCrunch, and he\\'s also spent time leading content for Samsung NEXT and as a venture partner at 500 Startups. Lucinda joins us from Fortune, where she wrote the Term Sheet newsletter and co-chaired the Fortune Brainstorm Tech event series.Please join the Axios Pro waitlist.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Annelise Capossela/Axios\\xa0The traditional retail LBO is dying, Axios\\' Richard Collings reports.The old model was to lever up, cut costs, monetize real estate, use cash flow to service debt, extract dividends, rinse and repeat.But that\\'s no longer flying, even as the industry emerges from the pandemic, due to rich valuations and a low appetite for credit risk.By the numbers: North American retail buyout volume sunk to less than $1 billion in Q3, per Mergermarket data. Industry sources said credit markets are only willing to lever traditional retailers up to 2.5 X EBITDA, a decrease from up to 4.5x in the first half of this year when buyouts of both Michaels and At Home group were transacted.Lenders are increasingly risk adverse when it comes to retail because they consider operational costs such as the amount of owed rent, in turn tied to lease agreements, as a form of debt.Some apparel retailers, however, have restructured/shortened their leases to address the issue.What they\\'re saying: \"There are three types of retail investments that will continue to attract investor attention: site-based services, experiential concepts that can drive traffic and brand banner stores that serve as customer acquisition channels in a more diversified channel landscape,\" says Ryan Cotton, global head of consumer at Bain Capital.2021 deals by Sycamore Partners, a firm historically dedicated to retail LBOs, consisted of providing debt financing to apparel retailer Express, purchasing cruise ship assets from Royal Caribbean Cruises in an all-cash deal, acquiring Ste. Michelle Wine Estates and adding a bolt-on to portfolio company Pure Fishing.The bottom line: PE firms with dedicated retail practices will have to be more creative about how they invest in the sector going forward.\\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyLee Enterprises (Nasdaq: LEE) said its board unanimously rejected a $141 million hostile takeover offer from Alden Global Capital, saying the $24 per share bid undervalues the local newspaper publisher and isn\\'t in its best interests.Why it\\'s the BFD: The local newspaper industry views Alden as both Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Future, cutting costs to the point that readers are no longer well-informed.Context: Lee\\'s move today isn\\'t a stunner, given that it previously adopted a poison pill, and that the investment adviser to one of Lee\\'s largest shareholders on Wednesday wrote that the company\\'s shares should be valued \"north of $100.\"The bottom line: \"Any argument that shares of a local newspaper chain should be trading at \\'north of $100\\' is a difficult one to make at a time when newspapers are in terminal decline. But there\\'s so much societal pressure against Alden\\'s bid that stakeholders may feel pressure to continue pushing off the hostile takeover offer.\" — Sara Fischer, Axios\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals🚑 Cerebral, a Walnut, Calif.-based online mental health services provider, raised $300 million at a $4.8 billion valuation.

If you had to choose, would you rather the audienceenjoy your writing or trust your writing? (Not a trick question.)Formal vs. Casual  Are you wanting to be conversational, or are youmore interested in being precise and proper and authoritative?Respectful vs. Irreverent \\\\u200d\\\\u2620\\\\ufe0f To what extent does the audienceexpect you to take the material seriously? How efficient, focused,and/or urgent is a typical piece of your content?Enthusiastic vs. Matter-of-Fact  What\\'s the right emotional vs.logical balance for your content?

Histwo sets of tips here are for improving your on-page conversion rate andincreasing your average order value (AOV).3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e34\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Five Email Marketing Horror Stories.No joke: I didn\\'t realize this blog post was from Campaign Monitor (oneof our sponsors) until I\\'d finished reading it. Granted, theCLIKK is anemail-first publisher, but... I felt this post all the way down in mybones. It was gonna get shared no matter who wrote it.Mr. Harris is 1000% correct when he opens by saying:When you work in email, sending a mistake is a matter of when, not if.Ask anyone who\\'s worked in email for a while, and I guaranteethey\\'ll have a story to tell you about an email send that went wrong.Some, like a small typo, are innocent enough. But others, like sendingto the wrong list, are a completely different story.Like... emails are written in permanent ink. You can delete tweets andedit posts, but everyone gets their own copy of your email. It\\'s likethe marketing equivalent of the gossip-and-feathers analogyfrom Doubt. It can f**kwith you sometimes.Those moments aren\\'t fun, but some of their payoff is when you readarticles like these and you realize holy crap, I\\'m not alone! Otherpeople screw up too!  3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e33\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 7 Things I Wish I\\'d Known Earlier in My SEO Career.This piece isn\\'t terribly \"skimmable,\" but that\\'s not a complaint fortwo reasons... the first being that it\\'s not terribly long, either.A second reason to actually read this (should the topic interest you) isthat it\\'s a rare collection of perspective and advice-especially forSEO which, as a discipline, tends not to be very chatty. We don\\'tusually see articles of the What I\\'d Have Told My Younger Self variety,and that makes this one particularly refreshing.3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e32\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 20 Illustrations of Google\\'s Link Valuation Principles.If you already know what we\\'re talking about, skip to the nextparagraph. If not, we\\'ll explain one of Google Search\\'s deepestfundamental principles real fast: Google\\'s most trusted way to identifya \"good\" webpage is to see how many other pages link to it. It\\'s thesame general idea as social proof, buttransmogrified into the algorithms that run Google Search-so when SEOsthink about links and link-building, they\\'re thinking about the\"credibility\" of their webpages as assessed by Google in this way.Having said that, we return to the #32 link from Moz, where 20 differentnuances of Google\\'s link valuation each get their own diagrammaticillustration. It would defeat the point to say too much more, so we\\'lljust leave you with a sample (below) and say that, if this is helpfulinfo to you, take the time to study it. Five minutes staring at adiagram beats five hours of circular, frustrating reading.3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e31\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 a Non-Designer\\'s Guide to Visual Hierarchy.There\\'s a wholeset of vocabulary behind the reasons you look at a webpage and go \"nope,that looks like an outdated crappy mess\" all within half a second. Thelink specifically covers visual hierarchy, which is the design principlethat things should be sized and/or visible in proportion to theirimportance.3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e30\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 5 Daily Habits of a Successful SEO Professional.Whether you\\'re an SEO looking to turn over a new leaf with your dailyhabits OR just a person struggling to picture what SEO people do intheir daily work, this post will straighten some things out for you. More specifically, it explains five good daily practices for SEOprofessionals (as the headline so concisely promises).2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e39\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 7 Tips to Write a Great Blog Post Introduction.They really are good tips... but if you\\'re like us, you see thatheadline and you immediately wonder whether this post will have a greatintroduction. Spoiler alert: it does, and it\\'s elegantly blunt. And we quote:Your title sells the click.Your introduction sells the read.Couldn\\'t have put it better ourselves. His title did sell the click, andhis introduction did sell the read. Touché, Mr. Drennan.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e38\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 9 Journalism Tactics That Work for SEO Content Writing.That might sound oddly specific, or like a weird intersection ofspecialties-but we definitely, definitely recommend this article ifyou\\'re in copywriting or SEO. It brings so many fundamentals together inone place. The \\'journalism\\' part of the headline is accurate, sure-but a lot ofjournalism advice is really just copywriting advice, and it\\'s soundadvice whether you care about SEO or not. We were so, so glad to see TheInverted Pyramid as the very first subheading because it\\'s one of thecornerstones of good copywriting, whether you consider yourself a\"journalist\" or not. 2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e37\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 16 Good Writing Tips.If thatheadline seems a bit plain, it\\'s because we went ahead and stripped thebulls**t out of it for you. You\\'re welcome.Having addressed that one gripe, we gotta say: for its word count, theimage below from SEMRush contains some of the best writing advice we\\'veever seen in one place. It\\'s nothing original per se-we\\'ve seenversions of this advice elsewhere-but the collection iswell-distilled, diverse, and honest.Speaking of honesty, here\\'s our advice about writing advice: you can\\'tshortcut the parts of writing that require effort, so you might as welllearn to enjoy them if you can. Good ways to do that? Read what you want(more or less), write what you need to say (more or less), and try tosee pushback as an opportunity to bridge yourself closer to your fellowhuman beings.That is, after all, the whole point of writing for an audience.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e36\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 50 Movie Posters That Changed Entertainment Marketing.We have a reel love for movies, and yet we\\'ve not stopped to think aboutmany of them in a marketing context. Well, the link provides thatcontext via their panel of contributing experts, and they provide justthe right amount for breezy browsing (one paragraph per movie poster).2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e35\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 How to Script Videos for Social Media.It\\'s easy to forget that the words spoken aloud in a marketing videocount as \"copywriting.\" Point being that, even if you\\'re photogenic andconfident on camera, you need to have the right message composed withthe right words-and if you haven\\'t written it in advance, there\\'s a99% chance you will be pulling the copy directly out of your ass. Notideal if you want things to work. Check out the quick, tidy, five-step guide from Social Media Examiner(linked above) on how to structure the video script so that viewers stayengaged for as long as possible and take the action you want them totake at the end.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e34\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 The Problem with the \"Sales Funnel\" Concept.This was ahistory lesson we didn\\'t know we needed until we\\'d had it. With asurprising degree of precision, the author dissects the history of theSales Funnel idea we employ all the time and explains (basically) howit\\'s a useful oversimplification and not an accurate reflection ofreality.The article is just the right length for the topic it\\'s covering-nottoo long, not too short, but juuuuuuust right-and it\\'s good writingsupported by good graphics and diagrams. Like this careful definition ofadvertising from Les Binet:2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e33\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Build Instagram Guides and They Will Come.If you don\\'t already knowabout Instagram Guides, it\\'s probably because Facebook HQ has beenfrantically adding features to their platforms (Instagram included) forquite some time now. Also, they\\'ve been up to their eyeballs in scandalsince Cambridge Analytica.Anyhow, Guides are basically a hybrid between Instagram carousels andblog posts, like a manually-curated slideshow of existing brand content.The linked post from Hootsuite outlines 10 unique ways marketers can useInstagram Guides. Don\\'t worry if you\\'d be starting all the way from thebeginning with Guides; the author takes that possibility into account.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e32\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Beginner\\'s Guide to Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).This is a fancy term for \"getting as many people as possible to do thethings you want them to do on your thing,\" whether that\\'s purchasing orsubscribing or signing up for a trial or whatever else.Alas, the phrasing of the term obscures the term\\'s importance.Optimization often implies a marginal return, like honing a blade whenit\\'s already sharp-but CRO can make a gigantic difference for thebusinesses undertaking it. Why? Because it happens so close to themoney, and because typical conversion rates leave so much room forimprovement.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e31\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Six Words That Make You Sound Weak.The content is a tad fluffy, as is typical with Fast Company\\'sstuff-and yet it\\'s still a very good reminder that we all need tospeak with conviction  tobe taken seriously.Also, that headline.

Today\\'s word count: 1,734 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏀 High school Super League takes flightIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0European soccer\\'s Super League fell apart two days after it was announced. That didn\\'t stop America\\'s top high school basketball programs from forming a Super League of their own.State of play: The National Interscholastic Basketball Conference (NIBC) began its first full season this month, with eight of the nation\\'s best teams competing head-to-head at venues across the country.Montverde Academy (Montverde, Florida)IMG Academy (Bradenton, Florida)Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)Sunrise Christian Academy (Bel Aire, Kansas)La Lumiere (La Porte, Indiana)Wasatch Academy (Mt. Pleasant, Utah)Legacy Early College (Greenville, South Carolina)Bishop Walsh (Cumberland, Maryland)Between the lines: Just how much talent is in this league? The NIBC features 15 of the top 50 seniors in the nation, and the 2021 edition of March Madness featured 44 players from NIBC schools.The eight NIBC schools have won the past eight high school national championships, with Montverde taking home five titles.Montverde produced seven draft picks in the 2021 NBA draft, including four first-rounders: Cade Cunningham (No. 1), Scottie Barnes (No. 4), Moses Moody (No. 14) and Day\\'Ron Sharpe (No. 29).La Lumiere (3-0) sits atop the standings after Week 1, with Oak Hill (0-3) bringing up the rear. The action continues this weekend (tonight through Saturday) on ESPN+.The backdrop: When games were canceled last season amid the pandemic, some current NIBC teams organized their own competitions. From there, the idea to form their own league was born.The NIBC arrives during a time of dramatic change, with a growing number of elite prospects skipping college for the G League or opting out of high school to join Overtime Elite.While those leagues provide a paid pathway to the NBA, the NIBC is fully amateur, allowing players to keep their options open with regards to playing in college one day.The bottom line: As the opportunities available to teenage hoops stars continue to diversify, elite high schools must adjust. Don\\'t be surprised if the NIBC adds more teams, or if competing leagues pop up.\\xa0\\xa02. 🐎 Medina Spirit: A race horse, rememberedPhoto: Rob Carr/Getty Images\\xa0Medina Spirit died at California\\'s Santa Anita Park on Monday from a \"probable cardiac event\" just seven months after his Kentucky Derby win was marred by a positive drug test, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Why it matters: His sudden death and doping history may be linked, which is part of a broader issue in horse racing — a sport that has for years been on life support and is in desperate need of change.The backdrop: Medina Spirit was born on April 5, 2018, at a modest farm in Ocala, Florida — not one of the mega-breeders so many champions come from.Early years: Born to a dam who couldn\\'t produce milk and a sire with a humble pedigree, Medina\\'s origins hardly foretold his future success. None of that mattered to breeder Gail Rice. \"He floated, and he was happy all the time,\" she told WashPost.Sales: He was sold as a yearling in January 2019 for the bare minimum, $1,000, to the lone buyer who showed interest. \"He was just athletic-looking,\" the buyer said. He was re-sold at age two for a still modest $35,000 to Saudi businessman Amr Zedan, who hired the controversial yet legendary Bob Baffert as his trainer.Racing career: In 10 races, Medina Spirit never finished worse than third. His last race was a second-place finish at the Breeders\\' Cup Classic last month.The big picture: The official cause of Medina Spirit\\'s death is yet to be determined (results of a necropsy are still forthcoming), but it may be inextricably tied to the issues with the sport at large.A week after the Derby, he tested positive for betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid that\\'s legal, but not in such close proximity to a race. His win is still under review, and may yet be revoked.That was the fifth positive among Baffert\\'s horses in the span of a year, and 30th overall. Medina is the 75th horse of Baffert\\'s to die in California, the most-ever on a per-start basis, per WashPost.Since December 2018, over 70 horses have died at Santa Anita Park, mostly from fractures leading to euthanasia. One report suggests over 1,000 horses die in the U.S. every year.What\\'s next: The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, which will aim to reform anti-doping measures and improve racetrack safety, goes into effect next summer.\\xa0\\xa03. 🏈 NFL power rankings: Week 14Table: Axios VisualsThe Cardinals, Packers and Bucs — the top three teams in our power rankings — can all clinch playoff spots this weekend, Jeff writes.AFC playoff picture: 1.

Endeavor, which has experience negotiating large media deals, believes they can change that.The company has formed Diamond Baseball Holdings, which will oversee ticket sales, sponsorships, naming rights, food and beverage, and media rights for all nine teams.Diamond Baseball Holdings hopes to negotiate deals with streaming services, per Bloomberg. It will also book concerts at venues.The backdrop: This comes on the heels of MLB\\'s minor league restructuring, which cut the number of teams by 25%. Starting next season, MLB teams will be required to provide housing.\\xa0\\xa06. ⚽️ Champions League: Barça out Photo: Stefan Matzke/Corbis via Getty ImagesBarcelona\\'s streak of 17 straight Champions League knockout stage appearances ended Wednesday in a 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich.Why it matters: It was the second-longest streak in Champions League history, trailing only Real Madrid\\'s active 25-season streak.Of note: Barça\\'s streak started in Messi\\'s first season in the senior team (2004-05), and ends in the club\\'s first season since he left.State of play: We (almost) know the 16 clubs advancing to the knockout stage.

Those names!A different era: Berwanger played tailback, passed, kicked, punted, blocked, returned kicks and starred on defense. Known as the \"one man football team,\" he almost never came off the field.Fun fact: During a 1934 game, Berwanger\\'s heel clipped the face of Michigan\\'s Gerald Ford, leaving a scar beneath the future U.S. president\\'s left eye.What came next: In 1936, the Philadelphia Eagles drafted Berwanger with the No. 1 pick, making him the first player ever drafted into the NFL. But due to contract disputes, he never played a down.\"He was unimpressed by his football fame. For years, he had no space at home for the Heisman Trophy, so it sat in his aunt\\'s home.

For climate activists, the pledge was one of the most promising outcomes of COP26, cutting off money that might be used to support the building of coal and natural gas plants.The catch: To some critics, however, the promise smacked of \"green colonialism,\" as rich nations preemptively cut off desperately poor countries from the cheap fossil fuels that helped make them rich in the first place.\"This is already leading to harmful policies that will hurt millions of poor Africans by slowing down their continent’s economic development while doing little, if anything, to help fight climate change,\" write Todd Moss and Vijaya Ramachandran in Foreign Policy this week.The other side: The more than 1 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa are responsible for less than 1% of cumulative global carbon emissions, but climate activists argue the region\\'s projected population growth means that a green transition needs to happen now to avert a much warmer future. A report from the Wilson Center this year estimated if Africa\\'s per-capita CO2 emissions by 2060 — when the continent will hold a projected 3 billion people — were to rise to the level of India\\'s today, its total CO2 emissions would equal those of the U.S. today.Yes, but: While unchecked climate change would cause tremendous economic and social damage to the global poor, even tripling electricity consumption in sub-Saharan Africa with lower-carbon natural gas — the most abundant fossil fuel on the continent — would equal only 0.62% of annual global carbon emissions. More access to natural gas would also upgrade large-scale agriculture through synthetic fertilizer use, while clean-burning natural gas stoves would help save some of the 3.8 million people who die each year from the effects of indoor air pollution created by burning wood, coal and animal dung.By the numbers: Extreme poverty and lack of access to energy go hand in hand.Average per capita electricity consumption in the developed countries of the OECD is more than 50 times higher than it is in sub-Saharan Africa (outside of South Africa). By one estimate Californians use more electricity to power video games than all 53 million people in Kenya do for everything.800 million people around the world still lack access to electricity, and the increase in extreme poverty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused that number to rise by another 100 million.Blocking financing of fossil fuel development \"stands to forestall Africa’s attempts to rise out of poverty,\" Yoweri K. Museveni, the president of Uganda — where just 41% of the population has access to electricity — wrote in October.Between the lines: Critics say moves to cut off fossil fuel financing in poorer countries amount to hypocrisy from rich nations that are continuing to tap their own sources of natural gas and oil.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. The oceans are the next frontier for carbon removalIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The global ocean is emerging as a promising target for carbon removal efforts, according to a new report. Why it matters: It\\'s now clear that removing and storing carbon dioxide, as well as reducing carbon emissions, will be necessary to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. But using the oceans as a carbon removal platform will require first answering major scientific, legal and social questions.What\\'s happening: Axios received early access to a new report from the Aspen Institute, with support from the ClimateWorks Foundation, that details a strategy for fairly exploring the ocean as a possible carbon removal site.One possibility involves harnessing nature by planting mangrove forests and kelp that can pull carbon out of the ocean and store it.Another option would involve fertilizing the oceans with dissolved iron, which stimulates the growth of phytoplankton that can feed on CO2 in the water.The catch: \"The nature of both governance and science in the ocean presents a lot of challenges to that scale of development that would be needed,\" says Michael Conathan, senior policy fellow for ocean and climate with the Aspen Institute\\'s Energy and Environment Program. Nations claim exclusive economic zones (EEZ) — the territory where they can control living and nonliving marine resources — only for the 230 miles beyond their coastlines. EEZs often overlap, and farther on lies the open sea, which has even fuzzier international governance.What\\'s next: The Aspen report suggests clarifying national and international governance structures that need to be established before ocean-based carbon removal can move beyond the experimental stage.That includes ensuring carbon removal projects respect the rights of the indigenous coastal people who depend most of all on the health of the oceans — something that hasn\\'t always been the case in past experiments.

The metaverse medical studentIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0Medical schools are experimenting with virtual and augmented reality technologies to help doctors-in-training practice their skills.Why it matters: Replacing actors pretending to be patients with holographic videos that can be generated anywhere can make the hands-on part of medical education cheaper and more flexible.What\\'s happening: GigXR, a Los Angeles-based startup that provides extended reality technologies — a mix of virtual and augmented reality approaches — for teaching and instruction, is partnering with the University of Michigan to \"use holographic content to take some of the most complex parts of training doctors and nurses and make it easier through mixed and extended reality,\" says David King Lassman, GigXR\\'s CEO.How it works: When medical students work on their preclinical diagnosis skills, schools will often bring in outside people who will be told to act as if they have different conditions or injuries, or even use tactile mannequins to practice procedures.GigXR instead uses high-tech video capture to film a patient presenting various symptoms for a condition, then can project that patient as a realistic hologram in nearly any physical space. (You can see the tool in action here.)Medical students can interact with the hologram on their phones via Microsoft\\'s HoloLens app, and they can even look inside the body \"to see how their procedures are affecting actual physiological processes,\" says Mark Cohen, a professor at Michigan Medicine, the university\\'s academic medical center, who has used the tech with students.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsCharter is #1 in rural internet service\\xa0\\xa0We’re proud to announce that Spectrum Internet ranks No. 1 in the U.S. News & World Report 2021-22 “Best Rural Internet Service Providers” rankings.

Exploding demand for lab spaceIllustration: Brendan Lynch/Axios\\xa0Office occupancy rates remain deflated across industries, but one type of workplace is in high demand: labs, writes Axios\\' Erica Pandey.The big picture: A number of trends — in public health, American demographics and venture capital funding — are colliding to supercharge the life sciences industry.Driving the news: U.S. office vacancy rates are at 17%, but lab vacancy rates are at 5%, according to a new report from the commercial real estate firm CBRE.Money is pouring into life sciences companies. Venture capitalists are throwing money at gene editing and other promising therapies at the same time that an aging U.S. population is driving up health care spending.The annual amount of venture capital flowing to life sciences companies has roughly doubled since 2019 to a whopping $32 billion, per CBRE and CB Insights data in the report.Biotech job openings are growing at their fastest pace on record, outpacing the notoriously hot tech sector, per a CBRE analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Federal health care spending made up around 4% of GDP in 2006, but that\\'s expected to swell to over 8% by 2040, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Read the full story.\\xa0\\xa05.

Credit: Bryan Walsh/Axios\\xa0A new app allows users to create \"AI-powered paintings\" by typing a brief text description.Why it matters: The paintings are totally metal, as you can see above, but the app also shows the growing ability of AI to translate words into startling imagery.How it works: Created by the Canadian startup Wombo, the Dream app prompts users to enter in a brief phrase of 100 or fewer characters and then choose an art style, such as \"mystical,\" \"dark fantasy, \"steampunk,\" or \"synthwave.\"After a few seconds, an original image will appear that, as James Vincent writes in The Verge, \"matches your prompt in often surprisingly apposite ways.\"Between the lines: For the image above, I instructed Dream to render the title of my book \"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World — Asteroids, Super Volcanoes, Rogue Robots and More,\" and to do it in the \"synthwave\" style, I guess because it sounded futuristic.The result is something that feels appropriately apocalyptic for a book about the apocalypse, but also literal — see the seams of lava from the volcanoes and the nightmarish robots rising from the ground.Context: Dream is one of a number of text-to-image AI models that have emerged in recent years, most of which are trained on libraries of tagged images.The models identify patterns in the images and use them to generate a synthetic image that corresponds to the user prompt.The bottom line: Book cover designers won\\'t be out of a job anytime soon, but what these models currently lack in quality they can make up in quantity — and uncanny weirdness. \\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsCharter is #1 in rural internet service\\xa0\\xa0We’re proud to announce that Spectrum Internet ranks No. 1 in the U.S. News & World Report 2021-22 “Best Rural Internet Service Providers” rankings.

It was our space-efficientway to make sure y\\'all were getting your \"vegetables\" (actual usefulinformation) in the midst of all the holiday sugar. The earliest QuickCLIKKs were short and curt-one or two sentences each-and that fast,choppy pace was part of the appeal. Over the course of 2021, Quick CLIKKs became very, umm, flexible. Whichis a euphemistic way of saying \"we gradually bent the segment out ofshape.\" And we really did: Quick CLIKK entries went from a couplesentences apiece to 1-3 paragraphs of text and sometimes pictures too.The segment lost its sense of style even if it didn\\'t lose its abilityto inform (if anything, we improved the latter at the expense of theformer). It\\'s time to return Quick CLIKKs to their famed original form. Here\\'sthe useful limiting rule we didn\\'t have last time: Each Quick CLIKK hasto be short enough that you can read it aloud in a single breath.

       " 'Plus, junk bond market recalibration. | Tuesday, December 07, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Latham & Watkins\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 07, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Donald Trump isn\\'t saying who agreed to invest $1 billion into his nascent social media platform, which plans to go public via a SPAC.Why it matters: The merger already is under investigation by both FINRA and the SEC, yet seems almost eager to invite more oversight.There\\'s no legal requirement that SPACs disclose the identities of PIPE financiers, such as the ones that just committed $1 billion to Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media Technology Group.But such disclosures are industry standard, particularly when large dollars are involved. So the silence here speaks loudly.Between the lines: One possibility for Trump\\'s reticence is that some of the money comes from politically awkward geographies (e.g., China). Another is that the investors don\\'t want to be publicly affiliated with the controversial former President.Some readers have emailed to argue that the $1 billion maybe isn\\'t as solid as the press release claims, although that would be a cut-and-dried fraud for which there is no evidence to support. Put another way, it would be several steps beyond Elon Musk\\'s \"funding secured\" tweet.Also worth noting:Trump Media & Technology Group hadn\\'t publicly identified a CEO until yesterday, when it appointed California congressman (and failed Twitter litigant) Devin Nunes. Still no word on a CFO or several other key C-suite positions.A pitch deck filed with the SEC does identify 30 employees, but only with first names and last initials (a LinkedIn search doesn\\'t turn up anyone who says they work for TMTG or its \"Truth Social\" brand).It projects $3.6 billion in revenue by 2026, which would put it on par with Twitter\\'s current business. Plus 40 million streaming subscribers by 2026, which is roughly the same size as ViacomCBS\\' streaming subscriber totals today.State of play: DWAC stock was up a bit more than 4% in early trading today, to more than $45 per share, for around a $1.66 billion market cap.The bottom line: Trump\\'s silence on key issues speaks volumes about how this merger deal is unusual, meaning that its ultimate success or failure isn\\'t a reflection on the broader SPAC market. But, as we\\'ve discussed previously, it could create collateral damage.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios\\xa0Genesys, an S.F.-based cloud call center software provider led by former Skype CEO Tony Bates, raised $580 million led by Salesforce Ventures at a $21 billion valuation. Why it\\'s the BFD: Investors love call centers and the software that drives them, even if they drive the rest of us to despair. Among those investors is Zoom, which recently failed to buy Genesys rival Five9, after its $14.7 billion offer was rejected by Five9 shareholders.ROI: Permira bought Genesys from Alcatel-Lucent for just $1.5 billion in 2012, and then sold around a 24% stake in 2016 to Hellman & Friedman for $900 million. Other investors in the new round include BlackRock, D1 Capital Partners and ServiceNow Ventures.The bottom line: \"While organizations were already planning to take the traditional on-premises call center systems to the cloud prior to the pandemic, the move to remote work forced many companies to make the pivot more quickly. Now, companies are trying to go a step further and link call center software with programs like customer relations systems or marketing programs.\" — Joseph Williams, Bloomberg\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• YipitData, a New York-based \"alternative data\" analytics firm, raised $475 million in Series E funding led by Carlyle. http://axios.link/xLnY• Incode Technologies, an S.F.-based identity verification and authentication platform, raised $220 million at a $1.25 billion valuation.

Sports sponsorships can earn lots of eyeballs, minus most controversy.\"The fact that a major sports league and a team and the city are comfortable, a lot of opportunities opened up,\" Avi Dabir, FTX\\'s VP of business development, says of the Miami arena deal.He adds that FTX is now facing stiffer competition from peers for new sports deals.The bottom line: These deals were quickly mocked on Twitter, but they\\'re being driven by a viable growth philosophy.🎥 Watch: Staples Center sign being removed (Twitter)\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s new in your hometown with Axios Tampa Bay.Why it matters: It\\'s more important than ever to stay up to date on the events unfolding around you.Subscribe for free\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundPhoto: Rob Carr/Getty Images\\xa0🐎 RIP, Medina Spirit: Medina Spirit, whose 2021 Kentucky Derby win had been called into question due to a failed drug test, died Monday after suffering a heart attack during a workout.🏈 Heisman finalists: Alabama QB Bryce Young, Michigan DE Aidan Hutchinson, Pitt QB Kenny Pickett and Ohio State QB C.J.

Photo: Grigory Sysoyev/Sputnik via Getty\\xa0President Biden will seek to convince Russia’s Vladimir Putin in a phone call tomorrow that the price of invading Ukraine would be steeper than anything he\\'s faced in the past.Driving the news: Biden held a call on Ukraine this evening with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the U.K., while Secretary of State Tony Blinken called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to offer America\\'s \"unwavering support.\"State of play: The U.S. has been coordinating sanctions with European allies to be triggered if Putin proceeds.A senior administration official told reporters today that the U.S. is also prepared to send additional military aid to Ukraine and increase its troop presence, capabilities and military exercises on NATO\\'s \"eastern flank\" in response to a Russian incursion.Yes, but: The U.S. has no intention of using military force to defend Ukraine, and Putin is “not afraid of sanctions at all,” says Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of Moscow-based political analysis firm R.Politik.The most drastic sanctions move reportedly under discussion would involve disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international payments system. Russia’s central bank has already worked with Russian banks to prepare for that scenario, Stanovaya notes.Russia has deployed some 94,000 troops to various points near the border, and is \"stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine,\" the senior official briefed reporters ahead of the Biden-Putin conversation.The White House has also warned that the Kremlin is waging a disinformation campaign against Ukraine, potentially as a pretext to blame Kyiv for any military clash.“We do not know whether President Putin has made a decision about further military escalation in Ukraine. But we do know that he is putting in place the capacity to engage in such escalation should he decide to do so,\" the official said.Flashback: This is the second time a looming crisis has triggered a high-profile tête-à-tête with Putin — the first being the Geneva summit in June. The administration had hoped to keep Russia on the back burner, avoid escalation, and focus on China.The other side: Putin has set out red lines of his own ahead of the call, including the potential deployment by NATO of offensive missiles systems on Ukrainian territory.He\\'s also seeking a legally binding guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward, including to Ukraine.In addition, Moscow has objected to NATO exercises near the Russian borders and increased cooperation between the alliance and Ukraine.Zelensky today visited the front lines of Ukraine’s simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists and issued a statement saying Ukraine\\'s military was prepared to “thwart any conquest plans of the enemy.”Reality check: NATO appears unlikely to either invite Ukraine to join anytime soon or to guarantee it never will.What to watch: “I think what Russia is engaged in is diplomacy by other means. ... \\'They will not listen to my entreaties, they will not listen to my diplomatic notes, they will pay attention only to my troops movements,\\'\" says Dmitri Trenin of Carnegie Moscow. Trenin considers an invasion unlikely, not because of the sanctions threat but the high military cost.However, Stanovaya expects Putin to issue Biden an “ultimatum.” If the U.S. and its allies won’t seriously engage over his desired security guarantees by early next year, “he will go to war,” she says.“I have never seen him in a position where he felt himself so strong, arrogant, self-confident and ready to go much further than we can imagine,\" she adds.\\xa0\\xa02. Global news roundupVoting by marble, in Gambia. photo: Sally Hayden/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty\\xa01. A Myanmar court sentenced ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to four years in prison on charges of \"inciting public unrest\" and breaking COVID-19 protocols. The military junta then halved the sentence to two years. She still faces additional charges.Driving the news: Ten months after the coup, the military continues to crack down hard on ongoing displays of civil disobedience. A military vehicle rammed a group of protesters on Sunday, killing at least one person.2. The U.S. today announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.3. Indian troops killed six coal miners in a botched raid on Saturday after mistaking them for a militant group, and then they killed seven villagers during the ensuing unrest.What to watch: The incidents have led to calls to repeal an act that gives soldiers in certain border regions additional powers to carry out arrests and attacks, and provides immunity from prosecution.4. Police in Gambia used tear gas to disperse protests today after opposition candidates rejected election results that showed incumbent President Adama Barrow as the runaway winner.These were the first elections in nearly 30 years in the small West African country not to include Yahya Jammeh, the autocrat who lost to Barrow in 2016.Worth noting: Gambians vote not with ballots, but by dropping marbles in metal drums.5. Peruvian President Pedro Castillo faces an impeachment vote tomorrow, just four months after taking office. The political newcomer has reversed himself on several key decisions, alienated his leftist allies with some Cabinet picks, and been hurt by corruption allegations against his chief of staff. The backstory: Peru impeaches presidents more than almost any other country (it requires just 40% of the legislature to impeach and two-thirds to convict) and is beginning to look almost ungovernable.6. Some kids in Manila returned to school today for the first time in nearly two years as the Philippines phases out one of the world\\'s longest school closure policies.7. India’s fertility rate has fallen below replacement level, according to the Economist, as more women go to school and access to contraception increases. The percentage of girls getting married by 18 has fallen by half over the past 15 years.India\\'s population is now expected to peak at around 1.6 billion in 30 years.\\xa0\\xa03.

Photo: Jemal Countess/Getty Images\\xa0The U.S. and several allies released a joint statement on Monday condemning \"widespread arrests\" in Ethiopia made on the basis of ethnicity, specifically of ethnic Tigrayans.What they\\'re saying: \"Individuals are being arrested and detained without charges or a court hearing and are reportedly being held in inhumane conditions,\" Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. said in a joint statement, noting that those arrested include \"Orthodox priests, older people, and mothers with children.\"Driving the news: Since a state of emergency was declared on Nov. 2, hundreds of Tigrayans have been arrested in their homes, at their workplaces and on the street and taken to overcrowded detention centers, the New York Times reports.The Ethiopian government claims the detained people are supporters of the Tigray People\\'s Liberation Front (TPLF), which has been declared a terrorist group.Witnesses told the Times they\\'re often arrested on the basis of their names, accents and other distinguishing features. The message that all Tigrayans are “traitors\" to be punished has spread widely on platforms like Facebook.State of play: The TPLF was the most powerful political faction in Ethiopia prior to Abiy\\'s rise, and TPLF leaders challenged the prime minister\\'s legitimacy in a standoff that led last November to civil war.The TPLF was quickly pushed out of the Tigrayan capital but mounted a counter-offensive and had been advancing toward the capital, Addis Ababa.Abiy announced on Nov. 23 that he would lead the federal forces from the front lines. The government announced the recapture of two key towns today.What\\'s next: The UN and U.S. are calling for a ceasefire, but prospects currently appear dim. They\\'re also pressing Abiy to stop blocking food supplies from reaching Tigray to prevent mass starvation.\\xa0\\xa05. Timeline: Two years of COVID-19Data: Our World in Data; Chart: Axios VisualsTwo years ago Wednesday, the first case of a mysterious new respiratory disease was discovered in Wuhan, China.The big picture: More than 5 million people have died since that first case. Most people on Earth have lived through some form of lockdown. 54% of the global population has had at least one vaccination, though the shots have been distributed unevenly.We know much more about the disease and how to treat it, but now the Omicron variant has deepened concerns about just how much longer the coronavirus pandemic will last.Here\\'s a look at the world\\'s pandemic journey over the past two years:Dec. 8, 2019: The first known patient in Wuhan, China, experiences symptoms of a disease that would later be identified as COVID-19.Feb. 23, 2020: Italy becomes the first country outside of China to impose a lockdown.March 11, 2020: The WHO declares a pandemic, with 4,616 deaths recorded.April 2020: School closures affect 82% of the world\\'s students, according to UNESCO.Sept. 28, 2020: The world crosses 1 million deaths.December 2020: The FDA authorizes Pfizer (Dec. 11) and Moderna (Dec. 18) for emergency use.March 24, 2021: Fast becoming the pandemic epicenter, India suspends vaccine exports.Early July 2021: After falling sharply in the spring, cases begin to rise again in both the U.S. and EU, with the unvaccinated hit hardest.July 29, 2021: Israel announces that it will begin administering booster shots, starting a trend across most wealthy countries.Nov. 1, 2021: The official worldwide death count hits 5 million.Nov. 5, 2021: Half of the global population has had at least one shot.Nov. 25, 2021: South Africa reports the Omicron variant.\\xa0\\xa06.

Photo: Li Boyuan/Xinhua via Getty\\xa0China plans to build its first permanent military presence on the Atlantic in tiny Equatorial Guinea, the WSJ\\'s Michael Phillips reports.Zoom in: The oil-rich country of 1.4 million on the west coast of central Africa has been ruled for four decades by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. His son and vice president, known as \"Teodorin,\" has been investigated in the U.S., France and Switzerland for allegedly embezzling national resources to accumulate hundreds of millions of dollars\\' worth of property and luxury cars.Biden\\'s deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, quietly visited Equatorial Guinea in October to make the case that \"it would be shortsighted of Equatorial Guinea to insert itself between the front lines of U.S.-China global competition,\" Phillips writes. The U.S. has also taken steps to build closer relations with the country.My thought bubble: The need to court countries like Equatorial Guinea is an indication that Biden\\'s China strategy will collide with his democracy agenda in uncomfortable ways. The latest: Biden unveiled a global anti-corruption strategy today ahead of his Summit of Democracy later this week.Flashback: China built its first overseas military base in 2017 in another tiny African state, Djibouti.\\xa0\\xa07.

Go deeper.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Allie Carl, Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0America's supply chain crisis is a series of intersecting bottlenecks, including insufficient labor and warehouse space, all driven by surging U.S. consumer behavior. But one piece has gotten short-shift on the attention meter: Chassis, the steel frames on which trucks carry shipping containers.Driving the news: Apollo Global Management is seeking a buyer for Direct ChassisLink, the largest U.S. intermodal chassis provider, as first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by Axios.Why it matters: Direct ChassisLink has an enormous amount of market power right now.Part of this is the supply chain crisis, which has caused thousands of chassis to sit idle, beneath containers waiting to be emptied. Part of it relates to massive U.S. tariffs on China-made chassis, begun under Trump and increased under Biden. Much of that manufacturing has moved to other Asian countries like Vietnam and Taiwan, plus some stateside, but the disruption took a toll. In short, existing supply is more valuable when prices of new supply goes up.Sources familiar with the Charlotte-based company argue that it hasn't raised prices commensurate with freight shippers or warehouse operators, and that it plans to add between 10,000 and 15,000 new chassis over the next 12 months. But don't be surprised if the next owner seeks higher prices for the next long-term contracts it signs, both with new and returning customers (in part to offset big new CapEx requirements).History: Direct ChassisLink has been something of a private equity hot potato over the past decade. Littlejohn & Co. carved it out of Danish shipping giant Maersk in 2012, and then sold it to EQT in 2016. Apollo took majority control three years later for $2.5 billion, with EQT retaining around a 20% stake.The bottom line: Chassis are a vital part of America's supply chain, and the most influential chassis player could soon have a new owner.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) is under pressure from activist investor Engine Capital to sell or spin off its e-commerce business. Engine holds around a 1% stake in the Wisconsin-based department store chain, although Kohl's has several other activists on its cap table.Why it's the BFD: Omnichannel is falling out of favor among some department store investors, with Kohl's being asked to follow the recent examples of Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's. The basic argument is that shareholders can get more defined access the the faster-grown business, and the legacy companies more cash to transform their physical properties. Primary sources: Read Engine Capital's letter, which argues Kohl's e-commerce business could be worth $12.4 billion as a stand-alone. Kohl's has a current market cap of $7.3 billion and an $11.6 billion enterprise value.The bottom line: Sayonara synergy.\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• TradeDepot, a retail distribution startup focused on Africa, raised $110 million in equity and debt funding.

Let that sink in.By the numbers: With 20 goals and 19 assists through 25 games, Ovi is on pace to set career highs in both categories: 66 goals and 62 assists.If he keeps this pace, he\\'ll top the 65 goals he scored during his 2007-08 MVP campaign, the most scored in a season since 1995-96.He\\'s setting up teammates at a rate we haven\\'t seen in over a decade. He already has more assists than all of last season (in 45 games).Milestone watch: Ovechkin scored his 750th career goal on Saturday, putting him 144 away from tying Wayne Gretzky\\'s record. He also became the seventh player to ever score 20 goals in 17 straight seasons.What to watch: Ovechkin has 273 power-play goals, one shy of Dave Andreychuk\\'s record. Will he make more history tonight against the Ducks? (7pm ET, NHL Network).\\xa0\\xa06. 🏏 Rare cricket feat: All 10 wickets Diagram: Harry Stevens/AxiosAjaz Patel, a bowler for New Zealand\\'s cricket team, took all 10 wickets in an innings this weekend against India in Mumbai, Jeff writes.Why it matters: Patel is just the third bowler in Test cricket\\'s 150-year history to accomplish this feat — which could be translated to \"recording all 10 outs,\" in baseball parlance.How it works: Test matches last up to five days, broken into four innings, with each side batting twice.An innings is complete when 10 batsmen have been dismissed, most commonly when a hit is caught out of the air or the ball hits the wicket.By rule, multiple bowlers must be used in an innings — usually between four and six — so it\\'s rare for just one to take all 10 wickets.Of note: There have been 2,439 Test matches in history, meaning this happens once every 813 games. It\\'s an anomaly, but it\\'s no perfect game (23 in 218,400 games = one every 9,495 games).Between the lines: Despite Patel\\'s historic performance, India is dominating New Zealand in the Test, leading by nearly 400 runs with half an innings left.P.S. ... If there are any \"Sports Night\" fans out there, this all might sound vaguely familiar, as it featured in a season one episode of Aaron Sorkin\\'s pre-\"West Wing\" sitcom.\\xa0\\xa07. 🌎 The world in photos Photo: Harry How/Getty ImagesLOS ANGELES — With his dad sitting courtside, Bronny James led Sierra Canyon past LeBron\\'s alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Mary, on Saturday night at Staples Center.🎥 Watch: Highlights (YouTube) Photo: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesCHESTER, Pa. — NYC FC rallied past the COVID-stricken Philadelphia Union, 2-1, to reach its first ever MLS Cup, where it will play the Portland Timbers.🎥 Watch: Game-winning goal (Twitter) Photo: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia — Lewis Hamilton beat Max Verstappen at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to pull level on points heading into the final race of the season.

Davis was diagnosed with leukemia, never played a snap, and died the following year at age 23.🎥\\xa0Watch: \"The Express\" trailer (YouTube)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏈 Stadium triviaPhoto: Timothy T.

       " 'Plus: Drone defense | Saturday, December 04, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Barclays\\xa0Axios FutureByBryan Walsh·Dec 04, 2021Welcome to Axios Future, where I\\'m waiting on Omicron lab data like this famous GIF.If you haven\\'t subscribed, go forth.Send feedback, tips and case contact tracing data to bryan.walsh@axios.com.Today\\'s Smart Brevity count: 1,644 words or about 6 minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: How AI could end foreign-language subtitlesIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0AI companies are developing methods to translate and synthesize voices in ads, movies and TV.Why it matters: The advances in voice synthesis could help fix bad movie dubbing — and they come as international content is becoming increasingly important to studios and streaming platforms as part of the globalization of entertainment.But they raise concerns about the possibility of deepfaking audio, as well as how a celebrity\\'s voice might be used after their death.What\\'s happening: Foreign-language hits like \"Squid Game\" and \"La Casa de Papel\" are drawing record audiences, but subtitles are still a stumbling block for studios trying to tap a growing international market.More Netflix subscribers watched dubbed versions of \"Squid Game\" than subtitled versions.With blockbusters sucking up a lot of bandwidth, smaller producers of foreign-language content are having a hard time finding enough translators and voice-over actors to meet demand.\"We\\'re still stuck in the mindset of the one-to-many broadcasting model,\" says Ryan Steelberg, co-founder and president of AI company Veritone.Between the lines: Veritone has developed a product called MARVEL.ai that allows content producers to generate and license what it calls \"hyper-realistic\" synthetic voices.This means, for example, a podcast creator could have audio ad copy translated into another language and then MARVEL.ai will generate a synthetic version of their voice reading the ad in the new language.\"It gives you the ability to hyper-personalize audio on a much bigger scale and at less cost,\" says Steelberg.How it works: Text-to-speech technology has existed for decades, but Veritone\\'s product makes use of \"speech-to-speech,\" what Steelberg calls \"voice as a service.\"Veritone has access to petabytes of data from media libraries and uses that to train its AI product, creating a synthetic version of the original voice that can be tuned for different kinds of sentiment or emotion, or with translation, speak a foreign language.\"It\\'s no longer going to be another person\\'s new voice speaking on behalf of, say, Tom Cruise,\" says Steelberg. \"It\\'s really going to be Tom Cruise\\'s voice speaking another language.\"Nvidia has been developing technology that would allow AI to alter video or animation in a way that takes an actor\\'s lips and facial expression and matches it with the new language — so no more out-of-sync dubbing like in 1970s-era kung-fu movies.What\\'s next: This technology will likely first be used in advertisements, but as it migrates to higher-quality content, it will open up potential opportunities and pitfalls for celebrity talent.\"In terms of dubbing and post-production, synthetic voices will become mainstream, and you\\'ll see that built into contracts for talent,\" says Steelberg. That won\\'t just be to ensure Hollywood stars (and their agents) get a cut for any use of their synthesized voice, but also to prevent those voices from being hijacked for malign purposes as the technology becomes more accessible.What to watch: How the voices and other creative attributes of deceased celebrities might be harnessed by AI.Holograms of dead musicians like Frank Zappa are already being used to front \"live\" shows that have brought in tens of millions in revenue, while Kenny G recently released a \"duet\" with the jazz great Stan Getz, who died 30 years ago. Sample notes from Getz\\'s existing library were used to generate a new, synthetic melody — albeit one that jazz writer Ted Gioia called a \"Frankenstein record.\"The bottom line: We should get used to hearing celebrities speak in almost any language soon — and those celebrities should get used to going through their wills with a fine-toothed comb. Share this story.\\xa0\\xa02. Defending against drones is becoming a businessIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Companies are developing ways to defend airports and other critical infrastructure from accidental incursions and deliberate attacks by aerial drones.Why it matters: Drones provide cheap and easy ways to monitor land, deliver goods and simply explore. But as they proliferate, figuring out a method to prevent them from going where they shouldn\\'t will become increasingly important.Driving the news: Intelligence documents published in October indicate a small quadcopter-type drone was used in an attempted attack on a Pennsylvania power substation last year — the first known time a drone was used against the electrical grid.Drones have been repeatedly sighted near airports, where they can interfere with takeoffs and landings. One such event shut down London\\'s Gatwick airport for two days in 2018, and a drone attack on a Saudi airport in October injured 10 people.\"Drones are the easiest way someone can breach security these days,\" says Aaditya Devarakonda, CEO of the drone defense company Dedrone.By the numbers: Dedrone found a 217% increase in unauthorized drone access to nine selected U.S. facilities between 2019 and 2020, and it says the number has only increased since then.How it works: Dedrone\\'s first line of defense is sensors capable of picking up the radio frequency signals used to communicate with and control a drone, or it uses radar or visual images.\"That can inform the strategy and how they would deploy security personnel at a site like an airport,\" says Devarakonda.For government organizations that need to protect important assets, Dedrone offers machines that can jam the frequencies drones use to operate, which can neutralize or even turn them back.What\\'s next: The Federal Aviation Administration — which sees more than 100 drones buzzing near airports per month — recently began work at the Atlantic City Airport in New Jersey on better drone detecting technology. The bottom line: Devarakonda worries real change won\\'t come until there\\'s a drone equivalent of 9/11. \"If some bad person wants to do it,\" he says, \"it\\'s very easy.\"Share this story\\xa0\\xa03. UN: 63% of the world uses the internetIllustration: Rebecca Zisser/Axios\\xa0The percentage of the global population using the internet surged from 54% to 63% between 2019 and 2021, according to the UN\\'s International Telecommunication Union. That means hundreds of millions of people logged on for the first time during the pandemic, writes Axios\\' Dave Lawler.Breaking it down: Perhaps unsurprisingly, there\\'s a big divide globally between residents of urban (76%) and rural (39%) areas. 15- to 24-year-olds (71%) are also more likely to use the internet than older people (57%).Africa (33%) is far behind. Internet usage is at least 60% in every other region.Mobile broadband is the main source of internet access in the developing world, and 4G networks now reach 88% of the world\\'s population. Still, 390 million people aren\\'t covered even by 2G.Yes, but: More countries are interrupting or censoring the internet that their citizens access.\\xa0\\xa0A message from BarclaysIs there a case for Fedcoin?\\xa0\\xa0Private digital currencies are proliferating, but absent US Federal Reserve oversight they could pose a systemic risk, to say nothing of the potential threat to US dollar primacy.

U.S. faces urgent anti-hacker crisisIllustration: Allie Carl/Axios\\xa0The Biden administration is accelerating efforts to fill nearly 600,000 vacant cybersecurity positions in the public and private sectors. The openings are bogging down efforts to protect digital infrastructure, Axios\\' Sophia Cai writes.Why it matters: Following a deluge of\\xa0ransomware attacks targeting critical government and corporate infrastructure, clogs in the talent pipeline are leaving government and big business even more susceptible to hacking.The issue has emerged repeatedly in Senate and House hearings but received little public attention until recently.What we\\'re watching: Private companies like GuidePoint Security are trying one way to fill the void: training veterans leaving the military for careers in cybersecurity.“It takes way too long to bring people into the federal government,” Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly told the House Committee on Homeland Security.Driving the news: A job-tracking database funded by the Commerce Department shows there are nearly 600,000 U.S. cyber job openings.The Department of Homeland Security currently has about 1,500 cybersecurity-related vacancies, affecting the agency\\'s efforts to protect the homeland.Read the full story.\\xa0\\xa05.

Credit: Bryan Walsh/Axios\\xa0Spotify Wrapped — the music streaming service\\'s personalized year-end review of your listening habits, which was released Wednesday — is probably the most fun use of surveillance capitalism out there. Yes, but: The lists should also remind us that there\\'s a difference between the data we generate — which machines can record and analyze — and our actual, inner tastes —which they can\\'t. Yet.What\\'s happening: Above, you can see my top five Spotify tracks, which range from a legitimate hip-hop banger to an omnipresent tune from the \"Frozen\" soundtrack to goofy Halloween-themed kids\\' songs.What they have in common is that none of them represent my actual musical tastes. I dabble lightly in hip-hop, rarely choose to listen to Disney soundtracks unless forced, and honestly had no idea pirate-themed novelty Halloween songs was even a genre until now.So how did they end up as my top-five desert island discs for 2021? The hip-hop tracks are for our family\\'s impromptu evening dance parties, while the other stuff is played on demand for a very demanding 4-year-old user who doesn\\'t have a Spotify account. I\\'m hardly alone in this — complaining about your kids messing up your Spotify Wrapped is now a mainstay of modern American parenting.The big picture: Machines are only as smart as the data we feed them, but just as the map is not the territory, the data is not always an accurate reflection of actual reality.That\\'s amusing when it makes Spotify think I have the musical tastes of a toddler, less so when it results in someone getting an unjust prison sentence. The bottom line: Though Spotify did indicate I listen to the National more than 97% of users, which sounds about right.\\xa0\\xa0A message from BarclaysInnovating to grow?

       " 'Plus: Talking sports with FTX | Saturday, December 04, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Goldman Sachs One Million Black Women\\xa0Axios Pro RataByKia Kokalitcheva·Dec 04, 2021Wow, it\\'s already December! We\\'re back in the cryptocurrency world this week — but fear not, this isn\\'t becoming a crypto newsletter.Feel free to send me tips or comments by replying to this email or on Twitter @imkialikethecar.Today’s Smart Brevity™ count is 691 words ... 2½ minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Crypto finally gets a shot at going mainstreamIllustration: Aïda Amer, Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Cryptocurrency companies are inking big sports deals, for everything from stadium naming rights to athlete and apparel partnerships.Why it matters: If the crypto industry wants to move further mainstream, it needs to reach a broader audience.The big picture: Since crypto exchange FTX announced its $135 million deal in April for naming rights to the Miami Heat\\'s arena, it\\'s also bought naming rights to UC Berkeley’s football stadium, agreed to sponsor most of the International Cricket Council\\'s events in the next two years, and was ubiquitous during the Major League Baseball playoffs.Crypto.com paid a record amount for naming rights to the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Coinbase struck partnerships with the NBA and WNBA, esports group Team Liquid, and Adidas.FTX has taken investments from Tom Brady and Steph Curry, both of whom the company calls \"brand ambassadors.\" Before going public, Coinbase investors included Kevin Durant and Serena Williams. What they’re saying: \"The fact that a major sports league and a team and the city are comfortable, a lot of opportunities opened up,\" Avi Dabir, FTX’s VP of business development, says of the Miami arena deal. He adds that FTX is now facing stiffer competition from peers for new sports deals.Between the lines: Sports sponsorships can earn tons of eyeballs, minus most controversy. Part of this is brand awareness. Part is greater crypto industry exposure. \"If people don’t know about crypto, then they won’t care about FTX,\" Dabir explains. The bottom line: These deals were quickly mocked on Twitter, but they\\'re being driven by a viable growth philosophy. \\xa0\\xa02. More FTXIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0More from my conversation with FTX’s Avi Dabir:Origin story: FTX jumped into the sports world after CEO Sam Bankman-Fried asked employees during a January 2021 all-hands meeting for ideas to \"get our name out there,\" and someone suggested buying stadium name rights.From there, the company investigated potential options, eventually initiating conversations with three targets.\"The Heat and the county [of Miami-Dade] were by far the most welcoming,\" says Dabir, who declined to name the other two stadiums. U.S. branding: While FTX’s brand has become synonymous with cryptocurrency derivatives trading, its U.S. customers can\\'t currently access a number of its products and features because of regulations. \"Do you wait until you have all the right products and then attract customers? Our culture is: We don’t like to wait.\"Most crypto-friendly: The NBA seems to have embraced the crypto industry more deeply than other major American sports leagues, something Dabir attributes to its early experience with Dapper Labs’ Topshot digital collectibles. Major League Baseball also quickly agreed to a deal with the company, he adds.  Yes, but: While FTX is paying UC Berkeley in cryptocurrency, that\\'s not the case for its Miami arena deal (\\'They definitely weren\\'t that comfortable.\").\\xa0\\xa03.

That's very, very bad, suggesting that investors aren't optimistic about the company's future prospects. Sure, it's slightly softened by the existence of a $150 million convertible note, but still... Source: Giphy3. BuzzFeed faced a worker walkout as SPAC holders were voting. 61 members of its news union members refused to work yesterday, representing around one-third of its newsroom, following two years of contract negotiations. BuzzFeed responded by telling the walkers that they must either use PTO or get docked a day's pay.  Source: Giphy4. BuzzFeed has valuation blues. The redemptions drop the SPAC value down from its original $1.5 billion, which already was below the $1.7 billion mark it got from VCs in 2016. And shareholder NBC has been notably disgruntled over this development, which is why BuzzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti must give some of his shares to NBC if the stock fails to hit certain targets. For context, a source tells me that Disney offered $500 million for BuzzFeed in 2014, and then raised the bid after Peretti balked. But Disney never got to the $1 billion asking price. That $500 million offer, if in stock, today would have put BuzzFeed's value at around $950 million. If the increase was to $750 million, than Disney's offer topped what BuzzFeed got via the SPAC. Source: Giphy5. BuzzFeed's peers are paying close attention, because they're seeking SPAC deals of their own. Vox, Bustle, Group Nine, etc. Each of them is a unique snowflake, but BuzzFeed could set the public market narrative for lots of other digital-first media companies.

Why it's the BFD: Geopolitical tensions are bleeding into the capital markets.Background: DiDi, which beat and then bought out Uber in China, went public this past June and was valued at $73 billion. What it didn't mention, however, was that Chinese regulators had asked it to hold off, citing national security concerns about user data ending up in foreign hands. Just days later, DiDi was banned from Chinese app stores.Fast forward: Bloomberg last week reported that Chinese officials recently asked the company to devise plans to delist from the U.S. Yesterday, U.S. securities regulators finalized rules to forcibly delist Chinese companies that fail to abide by certain auditing requirements, although that doesn't seem to apply to DiDi. Bottom line: DiDi is delisting under duress. \\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Bunq, an Amsterdam-based challenger bank, raised €193 million in Series A funding at a €1.6 billion valuation led by Pollen Street Capital. http://axios.link/odMo 🚑 Acepodia, an Alameda, Calif.-based developer of cell therapies for cancer, raised $109 million in Series C funding led by Digital Mobile Venture. http://axios.link/lh3L• LingoAce, a Mandarin learning app, raised $105 million in Series C funding.

       " 'Plus: The biggest L ever | Friday, December 03, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Dec 03, 2021🎉 Happy Friday! You made it.Today\\'s word count: 1,953 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏈 Defenders crowd Heisman raceData: DraftKings Sportsbook; Table: Jacque Schrag/AxiosThe Heisman race currently favors two QBs, but it\\'s the three defenders in the hunt who offer the most intriguing competition, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Where it stands: Michigan DE Aidan Hutchinson, Alabama LB Will Anderson Jr., and Georgia DT Jordan Davis are all top 10 candidates, per DraftKings odds.Hutchinson spurned the NFL to return for his senior year and just played the game of his life. His 15 pressures against Ohio State were the most since PFF began tracking college football in 2014.Anderson, whose 14.5 sacks lead the nation, finished first in The Athletic\\'s latest straw poll, which features multiple actual Heisman voters (subscription).Davis\\' dominance may be the easiest to comprehend: How many other players stand 6-foot-6-inches tall, weigh 340 pounds and lead one of the best defenses in the sport\\'s history?The big picture: If the final vote follows those odds, it will mark just the sixth time in the Heisman\\'s 87-year history that at least three defenders finish in the top 10.2012: LB Manti Te\\'o, Notre Dame (2nd); DE Jadeveon Clowney, South Carolina (6th); LB Jarvis Jones, Georgia (10th)2001: DB Roy Williams, Oklahoma (7th); DE Dwight Freeney, Syracuse (9th); DE Julius Peppers, UNC (10th)1992: LB Marvin Jones, FSU (4th); LB Micheal Barrow, Miami (7th); DE Eric Curry, Alabama (9th)1986: LB Brian Bosworth, Oklahoma (4th); LB Cornelius Bennett, Alabama (7th); LB Chris Spielman, Ohio State (10th)1969: DT Mike Reid, Penn State (5th); DT Mike McCoy, Notre Dame (6th); LB Steve Kiner, Tennessee (9th); DB Jack Tatum, Ohio State (10th)Of note: Charles Woodson (1997) remains the only defensive player to win the Heisman, although his candidacy was aided by big plays at receiver and on special teams.What to watch: Seven of the 10 favorites — and all three defenders — play in conference title games on Saturday.\\xa0\\xa02. 🏀 The biggest L in NBA history GiphyThe Grizzlies beat the Thunder, 152-79, on Thursday night, breaking the NBA record for largest margin of victory (73 points).Of note: The Thunder lost to the Pacers, 152-95, last season, meaning they now own the worst road loss (73 points) and home loss (57 points) in NBA history.Go deeper: Box score (ESPN)\\xa0\\xa03. 🎙 Interview: ESPN\\'s Malika AndrewsPhoto: Jim Poorten/NBAE via Getty Images\\xa0Malika Andrews\\' meteoric rise began in the NBA bubble, where she was ESPN\\'s lead reporter at just 25 years old. 16 months later, she finds herself anchoring ESPN\\'s daily show, \"NBA Today.\"🎙\\xa0Interview: I spoke with Andrews about her bubble experience, the transition from sideline to studio, and what it\\'s like working with the \"NBA Today\" family.What\\'s the transition from reporter to anchor been like?I\\'m a worrier and a perfectionist, and live television is like the antithesis of that, so it\\'s been an interesting sort of push-pull of what I forgive myself for and what I don\\'t. But it\\'s been fun. I have a whole newfound respect for anyone who has hosted a five-day-a-week show.One of the biggest adjustments has been the schedule. I used to be up late after games, and now my schedule\\'s flip-flopped because we start getting ready for the show at 6am.What\\'s it like covering the NBA through the lens of an hour-long daily show? It\\'s a bit like a reality show sometimes, is it not?Covering the NBA is about covering people. I think that\\'s why it\\'s sometimes compared to a reality show — because you actually get the chance to know the characters, not just the teams.That\\'s why it\\'s so important to go to games and really invest time in the league and its people. That\\'s the foundation of covering the NBA — relationships.Looking back on the NBA bubble: What was that experience like living alongside the teams you were covering?I look back at the bubble as a net positive. Maybe it\\'s because of how my career continued to go from there. Maybe it\\'s because I got to cover things that aren\\'t often the central focus in sports. But going through that experience [with the players] created a different sort of trust.Also — and I\\'m not proud of this — it was my first Disney Park experience! I grew up in California, I\\'m a Disney employee, and I have never been to a park, outside of living in one for 107 days. So now I\\'m on a mission to go for real.Working on a daily TV show is a bit like being in a family. What\\'s the \"NBA Today\" dynamic like?It\\'s definitely like a family. Our producer brought bagels today, I brought cookies. We have a family dinner tomorrow night. And that\\'s what makes it fun — we all really enjoy being around each other.Richard [Jefferson] is like the sarcastic uncle of the group, Perk [Kendrick Perkins] is the good time that just makes you laugh. Zach [Lowe] is like your grumpy second-cousin, Ramona [Shelburne] is the chatterbox aunt, Chiney [Ogwumike] is the cousin who everyone wants to be friends with because she\\'s the coolest.And I\\'m the mom that\\'s like, \"All right, everybody, make sure you buckle your seatbelt! Get some greens on the side! Kendrick, you can\\'t just have pasta salad.\"\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s happening in your hometown with Axios Local newsletters.Local reporters will deliver the latest news and insights on sports, politics, and more.Subscribe for free.\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundPhoto: Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\\xa0🏈 Brown suspended: Antonio Brown and two other Buccaneers players have been suspended three games for misrepresenting their vaccination status.⚽️ MLS Best XI: MLS unveiled the 2021 Best XI on Thursday.

Photo: Bettmann Archives/Getty Images\\xa077 years ago today, the highly unsuccessful, one-year merger of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Cardinals concluded following their lone 0-10 season.The backdrop: When NFL players enlisted during World War II, some teams were left shorthanded. Three times — once each from 1943-45 — the solution came in the form of two teams merging.1943: The Steelers and Eagles became the Steagles, going 5-4-1.1944: The Steelers and Cardinals became Card-Pitt, derisively referred to by sportswriters as \"Car-Pitts,\" because opponents walked all over them.1945: The Boston Yanks and Brooklyn Tigers became the Yanks, going 3-6-1.By the numbers: Beyond the 0-10 record, the Car-Pitts were historically bad, scoring in double digits just three times and losing each game by an average of 33-11.Their QBs combined for a 31% completion rate with eight TD and 41 interceptions — still the third-highest total ever despite the shorter season.Their 32.7 yards per punt remains the lowest mark in NFL history.The aftermath: Three years later, the Cardinals — sans Pittsburgh — won their first and only NFL Championship. 61 years after that, the Steelers beat the Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII.Go deeper: History of Card-Pitt (Steel City Underground)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏒 NHL triviaLeon Draisaitl (on left) and Connor McDavid.

Wireless Mechanical Keyboard So many of y\\'all would LOVE using mechanical keyboards, but thefirst reactions tend to be...  I already have a keyboard. What\\'s \"mechanical\" here? Whatever. It\\'s a keyboard. Hear us out. This idea might bring joy to someone\\'s life.People who use mechanical keyboards love them primarily because theyfeel good while you\\'re typing. There\\'s a lovely, springy, clicky tactileresponse to every single keystroke, and the cumulative effect is toraise the fun level from John Doe In Tennis Shoes to Fred Astaire In TapShoes.Y\\'see, conventional keyboards are built using a membrane (basically abunch of sensors wired together on a sheet) and that design is so commonbecause it\\'s cheap and it works. But mechanical keyboards are built theold-fashioned way, with individual moving switches in every singlekey-and while this is costlier, it provides a much sharper tactileresponse than a sheet of plastic ever could.Mechanical switches can be built in different ways, which in turn allfeel and sound different. This video compares the sound and physical response of three popular key-switchtypes; we started the video at our preferred switch (brown).Our actual specific keyboards were/are the Das Keyboard Model Sand the newer,wireless Keychron K4pictured below (with a brown mechanical switch).Oh, and you can customize the keycaps! They pop right off with a keypuller, then you take any replacement set that fits and pop \\'em rightback on. Since we mentioned these LOTR keycap setsa few weeks ago.https://modernpublisher.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cua2V5Y2hyb24uY29tJTJGcHJvZHVjdHMlMkZrZXljaHJvbi1rNC13aXJlbGVzcy1tZWNoYW5pY2FsLWtleWJvYXJkLXZlcnNpb24tMiUzRnZhcmlhbnQlM0QzMjI4NzMzMjU2NTA4MSUyNnV0bV9zb3VyY2UlM0RBY3RpdmVDYW1wYWlnbiUyNnV0bV9tZWRpdW0lM0RlbWFpbCUyNnV0bV9jb250ZW50JTNEdGhlQ0xJS0slMkJzJTJCU29saXBzaXN0aWMlMkJHaWZ0JTJCR3VpZGUlMkIlMjVGMCUyNTlGJTI1OEUlMjU4MSUyNnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbiUzRHRoZUNMSUtLJTJCRGFpbHklMkIlMjU1QjEyMDMyMUYlMjU1RA==&sig=HvcggvD6AAujXj3NYuWXkY8Xtk5tLrZ7hGKkxusPCyH6&iat=1638537235&a=%7C%7C1000472498%7C%7C&account=modernpublisher%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=e%2FjFoq8InQ9g3ZJK5hEfijpxdzkQNl9LgdxZ9pnzLRY%3D&s=361e168f72403d8731a5fc96dccedc93&i=548A589A1A10585Quartet Glass Dry-Erase Notepads\\\\u2728 Dry erase can be a wonderful thing, but the writing surface isusually a big bulky thing not suited for life on a desk.When we saw Quartet\\'s glass \"notepads\" - tastefully-finished glasssheets with anti-slip rubber feet on the bottom - we jumped at theopportunity to reclaim Dry Erase While Sitting and we haven\\'t lookedback. By now, Quartet has a whole collectionof desk-friendly dry-erase devices.Two pro tips for any takers: 1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Ultra-fine Expo markers are a mustfor smaller handwriting, and 2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 a standalone DE eraser willeventually be helpful.Sara Noni Blankets   Kevin here.

People who write less will care less about pens, people who typeless will care less about keyboards, and so on. But following that same logic, people who do write a lot will have moreexperience to viscerally notice improved tools AND they will care moreabout the improvements because they spend more time with the tools. Evenat this very moment, you are reading an extension of this principle; weuse fountain pens and mechanical keyboards partly because the s**tyou\\'re reading now doesn\\'t come together easily, and all thescritchety-scratchity and clickety-clackity are creative metronomes forkeeping ourselves going. Like jazz, almost. If you\\'d like a full beginners\\' rundown on fountain pens,that\\'s one of the better blog posts I wrote for Code&Quill. I\\'m choosingto be lazy and not explain more stuff here because I worked hard toexplain it back then.https://modernpublisher.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuY29kZWFuZHF1aWxsLmNvbSUyRmJsb2dzJTJGYW1wZXJzYW5kJTJGaW50cm8tdG8tZm91bnRhaW4tcGVucyUzRnV0bV9zb3VyY2UlM0RBY3RpdmVDYW1wYWlnbiUyNnV0bV9tZWRpdW0lM0RlbWFpbCUyNnV0bV9jb250ZW50JTNEdGhlQ0xJS0slMkJzJTJCU29saXBzaXN0aWMlMkJHaWZ0JTJCR3VpZGUlMkIlMjVGMCUyNTlGJTI1OEUlMjU4MSUyNnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbiUzRHRoZUNMSUtLJTJCRGFpbHklMkIlMjU1QjEyMDMyMUYlMjU1RA==&sig=HgjqjVkuMdoki4hntUpXp4D8xK2MUMskkzTDPdN8AdNM&iat=1638537235&a=%7C%7C1000472498%7C%7C&account=modernpublisher%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=e%2FjFoq8InQ9g3ZJK5hEfijpxdzkQNl9LgdxZ9pnzLRY%3D&s=361e168f72403d8731a5fc96dccedc93&i=548A589A1A10593 Wall Hooks from HOOK  By way of introduction: HOOK is a supremely fun little store inTelluride, CO (a lesser-known but gorgeous ski town) and the namesake ofthe store is its astonishing collection of unique wall hooks.Oddly specific, sure, but this is the kind of browsing where there\\'s anexcellent chance you\\'ll find something that screams your name.

But we can\\'t tell you how many times we\\'ve sung Penzey\\'spraises, because their herbs and spices and seasonings have made so manydramatic differences in the quality of our cooking. By this point, we\\'ve stocked the entire spice cabinet with Penzey\\'sproducts-and you wanna know the beautiful thing about it? The pricesaren\\'t really any higher. Anecdotally speaking, Penzey\\'s stuff costs thesame as anything else you\\'d buy at the grocery store, yet the quality isnoticeably higher across the board.A few tips on making the most of Penzey\\'s: It\\'s wise to start with the smallest jars (shown below), then buythe bigger bags and refill those jars. That keeps everything uniform inthe spice cabinet and cost-effective in the long run of your kitchen. Everything Penzey\\'s sells is good, but some of their stuff isridiculously good. In no order whatsoever, we\\'d give special praise totheir garlic powder, cinnamon(s), nutmeg(s), vanilla extract, powderedlemon peel, smoked paprika, fajita seasoning, and Northwoods and FoxPoint blends. Owner Bill Penzey is very openly a grizzled progressive, which wemention because he (not a marketer) writes his own marketing emails andpolitics is often the topic and this combination shouldn\\'t work but ittotally does. He wouldn\\'t have spent $700K on pro-impeachment Facebookadsunless there was a winning strategy, and Penzey\\'s made some strong moneyby playingit out.SmartWool Socks   Yes, that\\'s one of thebrands selling socks for $20+ per pair and many of you will find thatidea upsetting. I totally get the sticker shock, because it once shocked me too. ButI\\'ve been recommending SmartWools to anyone who will listen for morethan a decade, and \\'tis the season to tell you why...I had cold feet until my feet got cold enough. I learned of SmartWoolthrough my buddy Bobby, who worked at an outdoors store. Cut to January 2009. The temperature is plummeting and Louisville\\'shumid cold pierces straight through every layer. While I\\'m runningerrands, I realize I can no longer feel my toes. But I also realize thatI\\'m next to Bobby\\'s store, so I hobble inside and buy a pair ofSmartWools in desperation.I return to my car, rip open the packaging, pry off my shoe, and...   Literally not even two seconds into this sock, I understood where mymoney had gone. I\\'ve been wearing them basically ever since. (Not thatsame pair. I rotate.) They can handle just about anything. Wool is actually something of amiracle fabric, and SmartWool money removes the scratchies and leavesthe strengths: Wool holds a lot of heat without trapping it (breathability). Wool spreads and dissipates moisture pretty quickly (wicking). Wool has natural stretch and it holds shape well even after use(elasticity). Maybe not all wool, but certainly SmartWools recover well in thelaundry.Salomon SpeedCross 5I\\'m on my second pair of SpeedCrosses, and I call them my spy shoes(really \"Sam Fisher shoes\" if you get that reference) because they\\'reall-black and futuristic and they give me the kind of confidence I\\'dneed to sneak into a Russian embassy on a snowy winter night. Orsomething like that.In all seriousness, these are amazing shoes whether or not you\\'re intotrail running (and I sure as hell am not). Nowadays, the main reason I\\'drecommend them-and the main reason they make me feel confident-isthat they hold grip extremely well in icy conditions. That\\'s just a big,reassuring cherry on top of an all-around excellent everyday shoe. Well, okay. They might look a little aggressive for everyday shoes ifyou don\\'t live in Colorado like I do. But they\\'re a helluva lot morecomfortable than snow boots if you\\'re trying to handle winter walkingwithout slipping and eating s**t.Oh, and there\\'s a GoreTex version for extra waterproofing. If you getthe GoreTex version, you might consider going up half a size.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC. All rights reserved.538 S.

       " 'Plus: U.S.-EU vs. China | Thursday, December 02, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By The ONE Campaign\\xa0Axios WorldByDave Lawler·Dec 02, 2021Welcome back to Axios World, and a very happy Hanukkah if you\\'re celebrating.Tonight\\'s edition (1,896 words, 7 minutes) takes off from South Africa with stops in Turkey and the Caribbean.Clarification: I wrote last week that I’d had a nice “Thanksgiving break up in Massachusetts.” That generated some understandable confusion. No breakup, just bad phrasing. I appreciate the concern!New arrival?\\xa0Subscribe.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Scary data from South AfricaRe-created from Our World in Data; Chart: Axios VisualsSouth Africa alerted the world to the Omicron variant. Now the data out of South Africa may serve as a warning of what we’re facing.Driving the news: South Africa recorded 11,535 new cases today with 22.4% of tests coming back positive — up from an average of around 300 new cases with just a 2% test positivity rate 10 days earlier. The country’s top public health officials expect that exponential rise to continue as Omicron rapidly becomes the dominant variant.Meanwhile, preliminary evidence from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) suggests people with “natural immunity” due to prior infection are three times more susceptible to reinfection from Omicron than from prior strains. “We believe that previous infection does not provide protection from Omicron,” said Anne von Gottberg, who heads NICD’s respiratory diseases laboratory. “We believe the number of cases will increase exponentially in all provinces of the country. We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease.”The NICD study did not examine the effectiveness of vaccines at preventing infection. Experts worry Omicron’s high number of mutations may render vaccines significantly less effective.What’s next: We’ll soon have a sense of how infectious Omicron is compared to previous strains, experts say, but it will take longer to determine whether it causes more serious disease.Zoom in: Stores and restaurants in Johannesburg remain crowded, the BBC’s Pumza Fihlani reports, and President Cyril Ramaphosa is resisting the idea of fresh lockdowns, instead stressing the need to accelerate vaccination.24% of South Africans and 41% of adults are currently vaccinated, among the highest rates in Africa but far behind many wealthy countries. Supply had long been the major roadblock, but Ramaphosa is now focused on reducing vaccine hesitancy.In a televised address on Sunday, he announced “consultations” on potentially “making vaccination mandatory for specific activities and locations.”The rate of vaccinations in South Africa had been falling for several weeks but has begun to tick upward since news of the new variant emerged.Zoom out: The Omicron threat has convinced countries to push ahead with policies to encourage or mandate vaccination.The German government today announced a \"lockdown of the unvaccinated\" — banning them from all businesses except essential ones like grocery stores and pharmacies — and said a nationwide vaccine mandate could become effective in February 2022.Greece plans to make residents over 60 get a shot or pay a monthly fine.The big picture: Many rich-world leaders, President Biden among them, are ruling out new lockdowns but pushing booster shots, rapid tests and masks.Omicron\\'s clearest effect to date is on travel, with bans continuing to be announced (mostly on southern Africa) and would-be tourists around the world reconsidering their plans.Even beyond COVID-19, border controls will increasingly become a weapon against infectious disease — whether or not public health experts agree they are effective, Axios\\' Bryan Walsh writes.Worth noting: It remains unclear whether Omicron actually developed in South Africa. It emerged on Tuesday that a case was detected in the Netherlands on Nov. 19.Go deeper: Omicron upends holiday travel plans\\xa0\\xa02. U.S. and EU signal \"convergence\" on ChinaPresident Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Photo: Jeff J Mitchell/Pool/Getty Images\\xa0The U.S. and the European Union are adopting \"increasingly convergent\" views on the threat posed by the Chinese government, according to senior Biden administration officials, Axios\\' Zach Basu reports.Why it matters: European leaders were initially wary of President Biden\\'s campaign to rally a coalition of U.S. allies to challenge China, hoping to duck a confrontation between the bloc\\'s two largest trading partners. But the winds in Europe seem to be shifting, in part due to Beijing\\'s growing belligerence. Driving the news: The U.S. and EU released a lengthy joint statement on Thursday pledging \"continuous and close contacts\" to \"manage our competition and systemic rivalry with China responsibly.\"The statement followed the second high-level U.S.-EU Dialogue on China, led by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman — who has been tipped as State\\'s point person on China — and EU diplomat Stefano Sannino.A day earlier, the European Commission unveiled a €300 billion ($339 billion) \"Global Gateway\" development program designed to counter China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative. The premise is similar to Biden\\'s \"Build Back Better World\" initiative.Meanwhile, the incoming German government — which mentioned Taiwan for the first time ever in its coalition agreement — is expected to move away from Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s pro-business, \"dialogue-first\" approach, says Noah Barkin, an EU-China analyst with Rhodium Group. \"We Europeans shouldn\\'t make ourselves smaller than we are,\" Germany\\'s incoming foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, told a German newspaper this week. \"China has massive interests on EU market. We should use leverage of common market much more strongly.\"Flashback: A year ago, Merkel was pushing to finalize a major EU-China investment deal over objections from the incoming Biden administration.\\xa0\\xa03. Turkey\\'s currency crisisA scenic spot to exchange currency. Photo: Umit Turhan Coskun/NurPhoto via Getty\\xa0Turkey’s central bank is scrambling to prop up the country’s spiraling currency, the lira, as rising prices leave Turks struggling to afford essentials and venting their frustrations with the government.How it happened: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has pressured the central bank to cut interest rates this year even as the lira has lost nearly half its value against the dollar. He has long claimed, in stark contrast to economic orthodoxy, that low rates limit inflation. Driving the news: He replaced his more mainstream finance minister today with a loyalist, causing the lira to fall further, and continues to call for additional rate cuts.Meanwhile, the central bank is selling foreign reserves to contain the lira crisis, but could burn through its dollars fairly quickly. Warnings of a broader financial crisis are growing.The opposition’s call for protests has been heeded in several cities despite the threat of arrests.Polls suggest Erdoğan’s popularity is continuing to fall and that he trails potential opponents like Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in a hypothetical presidential matchup.Yes, but: Turkey isn’t due for elections until June 2023. In the meantime, Erdoğan insisted in a televised address last week that Turkey\\'s unorthodox economic policies won’t change.\\xa0\\xa0A message from The ONE CampaignThe global fight against HIV/AIDS is under threat\\xa0\\xa0The pandemic has disrupted access to essential health services, threatening progress in the fight against AIDS.

The International Olympic Committee and the Women\\'s Tennis Association have taken very different approaches to the disappearance of Peng Shuai after she accused a former top Chinese government official of sexual assault.The WTA has suspended all tournaments in China and Hong Kong despite fully expecting to lose millions of dollars.The IOC held a second video call with Peng on Thursday, announced an in-person meeting for January and claimed to be pursuing \"quiet diplomacy.\"The Winter Games will be held in Beijing in February.2. The two most populous countries in the world seem intent on effectively banning cryptocurrency, Axios\\' Felix Salmon writesDriving the news: A bill set to be voted on by the Indian parliament looks likely to ban private crypto in favor of a cryptocurrency to be issued by the national bank. China has already banned cryptocurrency activity.3. The U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada imposed a new round of coordinated sanctions on Belarus today.4. Comings and goings...Far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour has entered the race for the French presidency.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has joined the Liberal Party to cement his alliance with a powerful centrist bloc before his re-election run.Cambodian dictator Hun Sen, 69, has backed his eldest son to eventually replace him.A court in Libya has ruled that Seif al-Islam Gadhafi, son of Libya\\'s late dictator, can run in the Dec. 24 presidential election. Another court ruled that warlord Khalifa Haftar can\\'t run. Both were previously deemed ineligible by the electoral commission. It\\'s all very confusing.\\xa0\\xa05. Data du jour: Who logged on in 2021Illustration: Rebecca Zisser/Axios\\xa0The percentage of the global population using the internet surged from 54% to 63% between 2019 and 2021, with hundreds of millions of people logging on for the first time during the pandemic, according to the UN\\'s International Telecommunication Union.Key findings:Perhaps unsurprisingly, there\\'s a big divide globally between residents of urban (76%) and rural (39%) areas. 15- to 24-year-olds (71%) are also more likely to use the internet than older people (57%).Africa (33%) is far behind. Internet usage is at least 60% in every other region.Mobile broadband is the main source of internet access in the developing world, and 4G networks now reach 88% of the world\\'s population. Still, 390 million people aren\\'t covered even by 2G.Mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous in much of the world, with 90+% of the populations in countries including Egypt, Mongolia, Peru and Thailand owning a cellphone\\xa0— though less than 50% do in Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia.Methodology\\xa0\\xa06. What I\\'m listening to: Zalmay Khalilzad on what went wrongKhalilzad. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\\xa0Zalmay Khalilzad was the point man for Afghan peace talks under Donald Trump and then Joe Biden. He stepped down after the fall of Kabul, having taken his share of the blame for the debacle. What he\\'s saying: Khalilzad offered his perspective on why the war ended with a Taliban military victory rather than the political solution he was seeking on the \"Intelligence Matters\" podcast. He also says Secretary of State Tony Blinken disagreed with Biden\\'s approach.Flashback: Khalilzad brokered the U.S.-Taliban deal in February 2020 that was supposed to set the stage for intra-Afghan negotiations to end the war.But there was \"no tight linkage\" in the deal between the Taliban promises and the U.S. withdrawal timeline, he concedes. With Trump clearly wanting to get out and the Taliban gaining ground, leverage was limited.Khalilzad initially proposed a \"50/50\" power-sharing government to be led by a mutually acceptable figure. As the Taliban\\'s hand grew stronger, it became clear they\\'d only accept a government they dominated.Still, President Ashraf Ghani insisted that any deal leave him in charge, Khalilzad says. Even late in the game, the envoy claims, he was prevented by \"Washington\" from leaning harder on the Afghan president to cut a deal and step aside.President Biden, meanwhile, pushed ahead with full withdrawal due to his concern that the Taliban would resume attacks on U.S. troops and his \"long-standing pessimism about Afghanistan and the willingness of Afghan leaders to come together,\" Khalilzad says. He says Blinken was among those who preferred a conditions-based approach.As the Taliban closed in on Kabul, they agreed to delay their takeover for two weeks and negotiate a transfer of power with former President Hamid Karzai and other representatives, Khalilzad says. Then Ghani unexpectedly fled and the Taliban moved in.What\\'s next: Khalilzad contends that the U.S. should still be negotiating directly with the Taliban on issues like counterterrorism, girls\\' education and the Afghan assets frozen by Washington\"I think politics is hindering steps that our national interest demands,\" he says.Go deeper: 100 former Afghan security members are dead or missing.\\xa0\\xa07.

       " 'Plus, JOKR isn\\'t playing. | Thursday, December 02, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Goldman Sachs One Million Black Women\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 02, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Grab today hopes to become the king of SPACs, no matter how uneasy  have been some heads to wear that crown.Driving the news: Grab, a Singapore-based \"super app\" maker, today will list on the Nasdaq, via a reverse merger with a SPAC formed by Altimeter Capital. It gives Grab a pro forma equity value of $39.6 billion, the richest price ever afforded in such a transaction. Grab, which launched in 2011 as a ride-hail service before expanding into everything from delivery to investing, raised over $11 billion of private funding, including at a $15 billion valuation in late 2020.It\\'s also raised dedicated capital for its financial services arm, but Grab president Ming Maa downplayed the possibility of a carveout, during a conversation earlier this morning.Big picture: Many big SPACs mergers have struggled in 2021.Grab holds the top spot just ahead of the pending acquisition of MSP Recovery by Lionheart Acquisition Corporation II, which is trading below $10 per share.United Wholesale Mortgages, which was the largest-ever SPAC deal when first struck, is valued below its $16.1 billion merger price.UMW supplanted MultiPlan, whose post-merger travails we recently  detailed.And then there was Bill Ackman raising the largest-ever SPAC, but then failing to buy a stake in Universal Music and getting sued.The shining exception is Lucid, the electric car company whose market cap closed yesterday in excess of $84 billion.The bull case is that Grab is the sort of high-growth tech company that makes public markets swoon, as evidenced by SPAC unitholder redemptions of just 0.02%. Plus, super-apps are super sticky in places like Southeast Asia, in part because slower mobile broadband speeds discourage people from downloading multiple apps (or running them simultaneously).This SPAC also has key structural differences from others, in that sponsor Altimeter has locked up its shares for three years. \"We wanted to align our lockup with the length of projections the company was putting forth,\" explains Altimeter partner Chris Conforti. \"I hope that becomes a standard in the industry, and helps dampen some of the more unscrupulous parts of SPACs, where it\\'s about getting quick cash.\"Altimeter also led the $4 billion PIPE with a $750 million commitment.The bear case includes unprofitability, mega-SPAC track records and North American unfamiliarity with super apps. Plus, Grab is diving into a public pool roiled by Omicron.The bottom line: The 10 largest SPAC mergers have all occurred since the beginning of 2020, so Grab may not be the record-holder for long. \\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyRumble, a user-generated video platform, agreed to go public at an implied $2.1 billion valuation via CF Acquisition Corp VI (Nasdaq: CFVI), a SPAC sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald.Why it\\'s the BFD: Rumble has become the favored YouTube alternative for Trump-type Republicans, claiming 36 million average monthly users in Q3 2021. Details: The deal includes a $100 million PIPE and the ability for existing Rumble shareholders to earn additional stock based on price hurdles of $15 and $17.50. Toronto-based Rumble\\'s VC backers include Peter Thiel, J.D. Vance\\'s Narya and Colt Ventures.Bonus: Trump\\'s own social media SPAC deal is seeking up to $1 billion in PIPE financing, although it\\'s been tough sledding, per Reuters. The bottom line: Wall Street is cashing in on so-called \"cancel culture.\"\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• JOKR, a New York-based grocery instant delivery startup, raised $260 million in Series B funding at a $1.2 billion valuation from Balderton, GGV Capital, Tiger Global, Activant Capital, Greycroft, G-Squared, HV Capital, Kaszek, Mirae Asset, Monashees and Moving Capital. http://axios.link/X0lQ • Smartling, a New York-based provider of enterprise translation software, raised $160 million from Battery Ventures. http://axios.link/03pW• Kueski, a Mexico City-based BNPL startup, raised $102 million in equity funding.

Back to complete secularity tomorrow, we promise! Is Die Hard a Christmas Movie? That might be a question of taste.Either way, we\\'d point out: you can take the Die Hard out of Christmas,but you can\\'t take the Christmas out of Die Hard. Or something likethat.Credibility notwithstanding, here is Maxim\\'s casefor Die Hard as a Christmas movie. If you\\'re sneering a bit right now,you could read Vulture\\'s 10 Great Christmas-Adjacent Movies That Aren\\'tDie Hardinstead. a Smart-Ass American\\'s Education in Dutch Santa.The smart-ass American is David Sedaris, well-known for his uniquely dryand jaded wit. This is his autobiographical short story \"Six to EightBlack Men\" and if that title raises an eyebrow, you\\'re off to the rightstart. You\\'ll be putty in his hands, in the best possiblebig-laughs-you-won\\'t-see-coming sense of the term.Or you can watch Sedaris read the storyhimself. The Insidious Inversion ofIt\\'sa Wonderful Life.Genuinely do not wish to shatter anyone\\'s innocence here, so we\\'reputting things in red warning font and please take it seriously: Do NOT click the link above if you want to preserve your currentperception of the movie. You will not be able to un-see the contentsonce you read them. \\xa0\\xa0Seriously, no shame in skipping the link above. It\\'s not like one ofthose real-life, \"they made The Wizard of Oz by abusing Judy Garland\"types of things where you\\'d be naïve or ignorant to ignore it. (Sorry to burst your bubble...?) This time around,it\\'s more like \"an incredibly sharp fan theory that turns the movie onits head.\" It made us appreciate the movie (and its craftsmanship) more,and we can still feel its warm center-but we definitely can\\'t see itquite the same way again. Hence, this is mostly warnings by volume.  Alfonso Cuarón\\'s Dystopian Allegory.There isabsolutely nothing in the content of this movie to suggest that it\\'s aChristmas story-but the movie was originally released on Christmas Dayfor good reason. You\\'ll see that reason about halfway through the brisk105-minute story.It\\'s set in a dystopian near-future where humanity is infertile-nochildren have been born for 18 years-and so the whole world hascollapsed, except (of course) for Britain and their stiff upper lips.The ironically-named Theo agrees to smuggle a refugee named Kee to thecoast... and let\\'s say no more of the plot.This is one of our all-time favorites, and a shorthand explanation isthat Cuarón uses showy techniques to tremendous effect and in ways that(ironically) don\\'t call attention to themselves. There are a couple ofvirtuoso long shots (uninterrupted takes from a single handheld camera),one 4 minutes long and we stop breathing somewhere in the middle,another 9 minutes long that ends with a moment of silence perfect beyonddescription.It\\'s a dark, heavy movie... but watch with an eye for symbolism andallusion, and the ending will say everything you need. Ebert\\'s review atthe link above. an ER Doctor\\'s Examination of the Home Alone Injuries.This modern classic is made infamous by Macaulay Culkin\\'s home defenseagainst Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, and its final act really does blurthe line between Cartoon Schadenfreude and Wait That\\'s A Real FootStepping Down On That NoNoNoNoNoNoNo-Ahem. Long story short, Marv and Harry would be dead. Then again, as thegood doctor observes, many of their earlier injuries would have renderedthem unable to proceed to the subsequent and severer injuries. BSO\\'s Live, High-Energy, Big-Band Christmas Album. That would beChristmas Comes Alive! by the Brian Setzer Orchestra, and it\\'s tradition(around here) to blast this album at obnoxiously high volume whilesetting up decorations. It\\'s familiar stuff, of course, but played in away you\\'ve not heard before.Apple Music SpotifyHonorable Mention  TSO (a different band) does a big, fun,electric-guitar cover of Carol of the Bellsthat hides under adifferent name.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

       " 'Plus: NFL power rankings | Thursday, December 02, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Dec 02, 2021👋 Good morning! Bring out the padlocks — the MLB lockout is here.Today\\'s word count: 1,708 words (6 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🔒 The MLB lockdown has begunIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0Hope you enjoyed the recent flurry of free-agent activity, because it\\'s likely the last non-lockout-related MLB news for a while, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Driving the news: The owners locked out the players after the collective bargaining agreement expired at midnight last night, leading to MLB\\'s ninth work stoppage — and first since 1995.Past work stoppages: 1972 strike; 1973 lockout; 1976 lockout; 1980 strike; 1981 strike; 1985 strike; 1990 lockout; 1994-95 strikeLockout vs. strike: Either employers withhold work (lockout) or workers withhold services (strike). While neither is ideal, lockouts are far less intrusive. Those five strikes led to 1,720 canceled games. The three lockouts? Zero.How it works: Everything aside from CBA negotiations is now halted. Contracts can\\'t be signed, injured players can\\'t work with team staff to rehab, zero communication between players and teams.The CBA governs the relationship between the league and players\\' union, ranging from scheduling and playoff format to payment structure and drug testing.The two sides must now negotiate a new deal before the business of baseball can resume. Neither side will get everything it wants; the question is how much either side is willing to concede.The negotiating table comprises commissioner Rob Manfred and MLBPA executive director Tony Clark, each of their top lieutenants, the eight-player MLBPA executive board and seven owners on the league\\'s labor policy committee.Where it stands: The disagreements stem from money, and the various ways that money is — or isn\\'t — spent.What the players want: More competitive integrity (tanking and revenue sharing among owners both disincentivize spending); earlier paydays (to ensure prime playing years coincide with prime earning years); no service-time manipulationWhat the owners want: Mostly, for things to stay the same. MLB set new revenue records for 17 straight years through 2019, while average player salaries have dropped 4.9% since 2016. They\\'d also like to further pad their wallets with expanded playoffs.Plus: On-field changes, like a universal DH or pitch clock, could also be written into the new CBA.Between the lines:\\xa0In the 26 years since the last work stoppage, immense distrust has been sown between the league and players; recently, it\\'s only gotten worse.First came steroids — now it\\'s\\xa0sign-stealing, sticky stuff and juiced balls. Just this week, MLB admitted to secretly using two different balls\\xa0last season, per Business Insider\\xa0(subscription).Add in the months of bad-faith negotiations during the spring of 2020, and it\\'s not hard to understand how we got here.Go deeper: A letter to baseball fans (MLB commissioner\\'s office)\\xa0\\xa02. 🎾 WTA suspends tournaments in ChinaIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0The Women\\'s Tennis Association has suspended all tournaments in China in light of the treatment of tennis star Peng Shuai.Why it matters: The WTA is the first major sports organization to push back this strongly against the Chinese government, and it comes just nine weeks ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics.The International Olympic Committee, hoping to deflect criticism for its comparably light approach, said this morning that it held a second video call with Peng — but didn\\'t share any details.Pulling out of China could cost the WTA upwards of $1 billion. The tour has a 10-year deal to hold its season-ending tournament in Shenzhen.The backdrop:\\xa0Peng publicly accused China\\'s former vice premier of sexual assault on Nov. 2, and was not seen for weeks after speaking out.Chinese state media initially suppressed all reporting on the case and\\xa0released an email\\xa0purportedly from Peng saying that she was safe.Peng held a video call\\xa0with the IOC in late November amid international outcry.What they\\'re saying:\\xa0\"Chinese officials have been provided the opportunity to cease this censorship, verifiably prove that Peng is free … and investigate the allegation of sexual assault,\" WTA chair Steve Simon said in a statement Wednesday.\"Unfortunately, the leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way. ... While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe and not subject to censorship, coercion and intimidation.\"\"If powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded — equality for women — would suffer an immense setback. I will not and cannot let that happen.\"\"This is ... about what\\'s right and wrong.\"Of note ... Contrast Simon\\'s words with billionaire Ray Dalio — founder of the world\\'s largest hedge fund — who had this to say on Wednesday when asked about Peng and China\\'s human rights issues on CNBC:\"I can\\'t be an expert in those types of things. I look to whatever the rules are. ... I\\'m not trying to make political comparisons. I\\'m basically just trying to follow the rules.\"\\xa0\\xa03. 💔 An American hero: Tate MyrePhoto: Scott Olson/Getty Images\\xa0Tate Myre, a 16-year-old football player at Michigan\\'s Oxford High School, sacrificed his life Tuesday to save his classmates from the deadly shooting that has claimed at least three other lives, Jeff writes.Students say Myre rushed the shooter — a fellow classmate — in an attempt to disarm him and give other students time to get away.He suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the process and died on the way to the hospital. Last week, he\\'d taken a recruiting visit to Toledo.The big picture: Myre, 16, Hana St. Juliana, 14, Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin Shilling, 17, all went to school Tuesday morning. They never came home.Those are the names that should be remembered from this tragic event, and an online petition is hoping to accomplish just that, calling for Oxford High\\'s football stadium to be renamed after Myre.\"Tate is not just a hero to his fellow students at Oxford high school but a legend,\" the petition reads. \"His act of bravery should be remembered forever and passed down through generations.\"The bottom line: We need more people like Tate in this world.

       " 'Plus: Return of the slaughterbots | Wednesday, December 01, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Barclays\\xa0Axios FutureByBryan Walsh·Dec 01, 2021Welcome to Axios Future, where my Spotify Wrapped year-end list had a surprising number of \"Frozen\" and Halloween-themed kid songs thanks to a very digitally savvy 4-year-old.If you haven\\'t subscribed, wait no longer.Send feedback, tips and your own embarrassing playlists to bryan.walsh@axios.com.Today\\'s Smart Brevity count: 1,592 words or about 6 minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Omicron presages a future with more border controlsIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The travel bans and border closures prompted by the Omicron variant likely won\\'t fully prevent its spread, but that won\\'t stop countries from leaning on the measures.Why it matters: The rapid speed at which countries turned to travel bans with the emergence of Omicron indicates border controls will increasingly become a weapon against infectious disease — whether or not public health experts agree they are effective. Where it stands: 56 countries were reportedly implementing travel measures as of Nov. 28 in response to the Omicron variant, the World Health Organization reported on Tuesday. That includes the U.S., which banned travel from South Africa — where the variant was first identified — and seven other countries in southern Africa.Other countries have gone further, with Japan and Israel banning all foreigners from entering their borders. What they\\'re saying: It\\'s long been gospel among public health experts that targeted travel bans are unjust and largely counterproductive, which was one reason why the WHO did not recommend travel restrictions when COVID-19 was first declared a public health emergency in 2020.Dutch health authorities announced on Tuesday they had found Omicron in virus samples dating from Nov. 19 and 23, days before South Africa first identified the variant, indicating it was already spreading in western Europe.Despite the U.S. travel ban, the first known U.S. Omicron case was detected in California on Wednesday.\"Putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity,\" the WHO\\'s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti,\\xa0said on Nov. 28. \"COVID-19 constantly exploits our divisions. We will only get the better of the virus if we work together for solutions.\"Yes, but: The full story on travel controls is more mixed, and there is evidence that reducing the pace of international travel can at least slow the spread of a new variant — which matters at a moment when scientists still need time to understand the full extent of the Omicron threat.A study published earlier this year found international travel measures put in place early in the pandemic were able to slow the initial export of cases outside of China.\"Travel bans, when you have a highly transmissible virus, never completely ... prevent it from coming into the country,\" Anthony Fauci told ABC\\'s \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"But what you can do is you can delay it enough to get us better prepared.\"Between the lines: Truly restrictive travel controls can all but extinguish even a virus as contagious as SARS-CoV-2.The countries that have most effectively minimized COVID-19 cases — like Australia, New Zealand, Japan and China — have gone well beyond targeted travel bans to near full border closures.Scientists in China touted a study over the weekend claiming the country could be facing more than 630,000 COVID-19 infections per day if it dropped its zero-tolerance travel controls.But those controls have come with severe economic and social costs, and the longer the pandemic goes on, the harder it can be to maintain those measures.The big picture: The effectiveness of travel bans may be secondary to the fact that they are a tool that governments can put in place — and just as importantly, be seen to put in place — relatively easily. Once they\\'ve been deployed, they can and will be deployed again.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. A dark view of the future of autonomous weaponsA still from the video \"If Human: Kill ( ).\" Image: Future of Life Institute\\xa0A new short film warns of the coming risks posed by the development and proliferation of lethal autonomous weapons.Why it matters: Drones with the ability to autonomously target and kill without the assistance of a human operator are reportedly already being used on battlefields, and time is running out to craft a global ban of what could be a destabilizing and terrifying new class of weapon. What\\'s happening: The Future of Life Institute (FLI), a nonprofit focused on existential risks from technology, today released \"If Human: Kill ( ),\" a video that depicts what the future could be like if lethal autonomous weapons go unregulated.In a word: horrific. The film splices fictional news clips to show drones and robots armed with automatic weapons using facial recognition to identify and kill political protesters and police, aid bank robberies, and assassinate scientists.Flashback: The new film is a sequel to a 2017 video by FLI that gave a name for these autonomous weapons: \"slaughterbots.\"While many of the concerns about autonomous weapons focus on the possibility they could turbocharge warfare between states, or even go rogue \"Terminator\"-style, the FLI videos imagine a future where AI weapons fall into the hands of criminals and terrorists who can use them to wreak havoc.Instead of Skynet, think self-controlled and self-targeting AK-47s, a weapon that has already killed millions of people around the world.

Image: Quantinuum\\xa0Two major quantum computing companies — one in hardware and one in software — have merged to create a new firm called Quantinuum.Why it matters: The merger is a sign of the growing maturity of the quantum computing industry, as it begins to shift from the lab to actually solving difficult-to-compute problems in the real world.Driving the news: Honeywell Quantum Solutions, which makes quantum computers that use trapped-ion technologies, will merge with U.K. quantum software company Cambridge Quantum, the firms announced Tuesday.Ilyas Khan, the founder of Cambridge Quantum, will serve as the CEO of the new company, while Honeywell\\'s Tony Uttley will serve as president and COO.The new company says that it will be the largest integrated quantum computing company in the world, with approximately 400 staff members in the U.S. and abroad.\"This is an opportunity for a new company to be a new center of gravity for the quantum ecosystem,\" says Uttley. \"It\\'s a match of best-in-class quantum software and best-in-class quantum hardware.\"What\\'s next: Quantinuum\\'s first new offering, a quantum-focused cybersecurity product, will launch in December, to be followed next year by a quantum chemistry product.The bottom line: \"People are saying that it will be 5 or 10 or 15 years before quantum computers do something useful,\" says Uttley. \"But we think the systems that exist now are extraordinary, and we shouldn\\'t lose sight of what\\'s possible today.\"Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from BarclaysIs there a case for Fedcoin?\\xa0\\xa0Private digital currencies are proliferating, but absent US Federal Reserve oversight they could pose a systemic risk, to say nothing of the potential threat to US dollar primacy.

How to grow the economy with biologyIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0A new report makes the economic and environmental case for the U.S. to invest billions of dollars to build what is known as the bioeconomy.Why it matters: Transitioning to bio-based food, fuel, materials and more could sharply reduce carbon emissions and provide a foundation for a more sustainable manufacturing economy.But while the U.S. is a world leader in biotech, it lags behind on the infrastructure and support needed to scale those innovations, the report finds.By the numbers: A preliminary report from the Schmidt Futures Bioeconomy Task Force calculates that the biology-based economy was already generating $960 billion in economic activity in 2016 — 5% of U.S. GDP.But should the U.S. invest billions in bioeconomy research and manufacturing, it has the potential to create more than 1 million new jobs, keep $260 billion in economic activity from going overseas, and reduce annual CO2 emissions by 450 million tons.The catch: \"What\\'s missing is the next step, the lack of basic research into understanding the science of manufacturing and the science of biomanufacturing,\" says Andrea Hodgson, a fellow at Schmidt Futures and co-leader of its bioeconomy program.What to watch: The report recommends that the government invest $600 million over five years in a Bioproduction Science Initiative overseen by the National Science Foundation, as well as another $1.2 billion in bioproduction infrastructure and public-private partnerships to scale development.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa05.

Tweet of the day: Ahistorical editionScreenshot: Sam Altman Twitter\\xa0The head of artificial intelligence company OpenAI and \"the most connected millennial in Silicon Valley\" believes we may be living through an unprecedented era of innovation.Yes, but: The late 19th century would like to have a word.The big picture: No matter how transformative technologies like AI and Web3 ultimately prove, they\\'ll be hard-pressed to beat the burst of invention that occurred near the end of the 1800s.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first patent for the telephone (though whether he truly invented it remains in dispute), while just three years later, Thomas Edison first patented the incandescent lightbulb.Details: That was followed by the 1880s, a decade that historian of technology Vaclav Smil has called \"perhaps the most inventive time\" in history. Among the advances that decade were:The first thermal and hydroelectricity power stations in 1882.The first multistory steel-skeleton skyscraper in 1885.The first commercial production of motor vehicles powered by internal combustion engines in 1886.The first electric street railway in 1887. The first production of electromagnetic waves in a laboratory in 1888, paving the way for wireless communication.And don\\'t forget: Coca-Cola, first formulated in 1886.The bottom line: We do live in a remarkable age, but that\\'s only possible because of the fundamental inventions of the late 19th century.Though did they have CryptoKitties NFTs?

The magazine choice lets you connect to a specific style already incollective consciousness, and the five adjectives allow you to color inthe descriptive details as you please.

Change happens fast sometimes.The current EV transition is exciting if you think of EVs as solutionsto big problems like pollution and climate change. But the \"catch\" inany problem-solving exchange is that there are no perfect solutions,only smaller problems. EVs can smash the pollution problem, and that\\'sfrickin\\' great-but a new and smaller problem is that \"stopping forgas\" will take 20 minutes instead of 2.This uncomfortable delay is a big cause of range anxiety, or the EVdriver\\'s natural discomfort around the recharging stops on long trips.You might be surprised how many charging stations are already installedalong American roadways, and adding a ton more is an obviousinfrastructural priority before EV counts boom-but as this fascinatingNew York Times pieceexplains, range anxiety doesn\\'t go away even if you\\'re 100% certain acharging station will be available to you. Oversimplifying slightly, but... yeah. We don\\'t want to wait for slowthings. And we absolutely HATE waiting for slow things if we know it\\'sphysically impossible for them to go any faster. The human brain hassome bugs in its code.First solution to the EV charging problem: learn to get comfortable.Well-adjusted people will learn to, well, adjust themselves to 20-minuterefuel sessions.But there\\'s a second, bigger, wilder possible solution here...What if the road itself could charge your electric car? Like a wirelessphone charger, except the phone is your car and the charger is made ofasphalt. Oh, and the charging bits stretch along the entire EisenhowerInterstate System. The aforementioned NYT article is really about this second idea and how(our presentation notwithstanding) it\\'s way closer to practical realitythan you might think. Purdue is already starting to build one. There\\'s a lot that has to happen between now and electrified Americanhighways, but folks are deadly serious about the idea, and they\\'reworking the problem knowing that they\\'ll have to overcome a series ofbig challenges to get anywhere.See Also  7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of MoneyADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

       " 'Plus, the latest on Ozy, Theranos and MultiPlan. | Wednesday, December 01, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Goldman Sachs One Million Black Women\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Dec 01, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Annelise Capossela/Axios\\xa0Kicking off December with some updates to recent stories:🌎 Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-focused VC firm led by Chris Sacca, yesterday told limited partners that it wants to raise two new funds. One will be focused on carbon removal and the other on fusion.Flashback: In August we reported that Lowercarbon had raised $800 million in outside capital. The carbon removal fund will be led by Ryan Orbuch, who joins Lowercarbon from Stripe, where he was widely credited with helping make the payments company a carbon removal pioneer. Per a letter sent to LPs and obtained by Axios: \"Removal means removal. It means cleanup on Aisle 2 of the 170 years of milk already spilled.\"On fusion, Lowercarbon already has backed three companies; including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which just raised more than $1.8 billion in new funding. Per the LP letter: \"The biggest tipping point will come when fusion reaction generates more energy than it takes in... Q>1 is the Kitty Hawk moment for energy. It\\'s Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic and Aldrin bouncing on the moon... We believe that one or more private companies and public research groups will achieve Q>1 within the next few years and then be on a path to commercialize fusion within a decade.\"Neither fund has a defined target, but both include at least a 15% GP commit and a 25% carried interest that can rise to 33.3% after achieving 2.5x net returns, per the LP letters.💸 Ozy Media, which recently imploded amid investigations into alleged fraud, has reached a severance settlement with most of its former fulltime employees, Axios has learned.Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway, who surrendered his Ozy shares, quietly hired law firm Wilson Sonsini to represent the ex-employees, with a final deal signed just before Thanksgiving. It included final paychecks, requested reimbursements, accrued but unused PTO and other owed wages (e.g., commissions).It\\'s unclear how many people still work at Ozy, whose CEO Carlos Watson didn\\'t return a request for comment. The team page on its website includes many people who are long gone, and the company is believed to still be under federal investigation by both the DOJ and SEC. Ozy does continue to regularly produce a newsletter, but no new podcasts or videos.🩸 Elizabeth Holmes continued testifying in her own defense this week. As expected, she used the opportunity to accuse her former boyfriend and Theranos business partner Sunny Balwani of sexual and emotional abuse. Balwani, who will be tried separately, has denied the allegations.Holmes is trying to thread an almost impossible needle with the Balwani accusations. It\\'s as if she\\'s saying: \"I didn\\'t lie. But, also, I lied because of Sunny.\" 🚑 A Las Vegas jury found UnitedHealth guilty of underpaying ER physicians at Blackstone portfolio company TeamHealth. Punitive damages are yet to be determined, and there are similar cases pending in other states.Flashback: We recently discussed this trial in the context of MultiPlan, whose post-SPAC stock has sputtered amidst short-seller suggestions that UnitedHealth plans to pull its partnership, including critical testimony from a former UnitedHealth exec.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Blue Prism (LSE: PRSM), a British robotic process automation company, agreed to a £1.24 billion takeover offer from SS&C Technologies (Nasdaq: SSNC) and withdrew its support for a slightly lower bid from Vista Equity Partners.Why it\\'s the BFD: Vista has a reputation for winning deals with its wallet, not for getting beat out on price.Background: Vista originally topped a rival bid from TPG Capital, but Blue Prism shareholder Coast Capital (2.8% stake) last week said its offer was too low. There\\'s still the possibility that Vista will come back over the top.The bottom line: \"The SS&C offer would give each Blue Prism shareholder 1,275p a share, a premium of 53.2% to the closing price of 832p on August 27, which was the last business day before sale talks were first disclosed... Vista\\'s price was a 35% premium to Blue Prism\\'s closing price in August but less than half its all-time high three years ago.\" — Sarah Provan, FT \\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Jobandtalent, a Spanish temp staffing marketplace, raised $500 million in Series E funding at a $2.35 billion post-money valuation.

More from Sarah:This is at the upper range of multiples for MedComms agencies, achieving a similar multiple to what The Lockwood Group recently scored from Ares Management. TPG’s investment in BGB Group, Eversana’s acquisition of InTouch Group and GHO Capital’s investment in ClearView Healthcare Partners all traded at around 17x.TLS likely benefited from one-third of its revenue coming via tech-enabled services, meaning it wasn\\'t solely reliant on people-driven consulting.What we\\'re watching: Medical Knowledge Group, a Court Square Partners-backed MedComms agency, is in the second round of its sale process, per a source familiar.

Happy Hump Day to you and yours.Today\\'s word count: 1,340 words (5 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏈 The penultimate CFP rankingsTable: Will Chase/AxiosMichigan\\'s first victory over Ohio State in 10 years has given the Wolverines their highest ranking of the CFP era — and a clear path to their first playoff appearance.Where it stands: Unbeaten Georgia remained No. 1 in the CFP rankings for the fifth straight week, followed by Michigan, Alabama, Cincinnati, Oklahoma State and Notre Dame.By the numbers: Those six true contenders all have at least a 32% chance of making the field ahead of conference championship weekend. Notre Dame, who just lost their coach, will watch anxiously from the sidelines.Georgia: 99% chanceMichigan: 72%Alabama: 59%Cincinnati: 74%Oklahoma State: 32%Notre Dame: 58%Looking ahead: Georgia is in no matter what, and Michigan, Alabama and Cincinnati are almost certainly in if they win on Saturday. If the unbeaten Bearcats get jumped by a one-loss team after beating No. 21 Houston, the entire system is broken.SEC: No. 1 Georgia vs. No. 3 Alabama (4 pm ET, CBS)Big Ten: No. 2 Michigan vs. No. 13 Iowa (8pm, Fox)Big 12: No. 5 Oklahoma State vs. No. 9 Baylor (12pm, ABC)AAC: No. 4 Cincinnati vs. No. 21 Houston (4pm, ABC)Other title games ... No. 10 Oregon vs. No. 17 Utah (Pac-12); No. 15 Pitt vs. No. 16 Wake Forest (ACC); No. 19 San Diego State vs. Utah State (MWC); No. 24 Louisiana vs. Appalachian State (Sun Belt); UTSA vs. Western Kentucky (C-USA); Northern Illinois vs. Kent State (MAC).What\\'s next: The final rankings will be released Sunday.\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 November was brutal for NFL bettorsIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The most unpredictable NFL season in recent memory is costing bettors at a historic clip, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Driving the news: November was among the worst months ever for the betting public thanks to underdogs covering the spread nearly 60% of the time and winning 23 games outright.Notable games: Jaguars over Bills in Week 9; Dolphins over Ravens in Week 10; Texans over Titans in Week 11.That\\'s part of a season-long trend in which underdogs are 99-77-1 against the spread — on pace to be the best mark since 1980.The big picture: While the NFL\\'s chaos cursed bettors last month, it\\'s made for a wildly entertaining season — and the upshot is a wide-open playoff race with six weeks left.27 teams are within 1.5 games of a playoff spot, and 25 teams have at least five wins (compared to just 18 at this point last season).This is the first year since 2014 with no 10-win teams through Week 12, and just two division leaders hold more than a two-game lead over second place (NFC North, NFC South).Wild stat: 25 games this season have been decided on the final play — the most through 12 weeks since the merger. That kind of end-game coin flip has helped cause this unprecedented parity.Playoff picture:AFC: 1. Ravens (8-3), 2. Patriots (8-4), 3. Titans (8-4), 4. Chiefs (7-4), 5. Bengals (7-4), 6.

Photo: New York Times Co./Getty Images\\xa093 years ago today, the NL proposed that MLB add a designated hitter — a measure that, ironically, didn\\'t come to pass because the AL rejected it.The big picture: MLB executives had pushed for a DH as early as 1891, arguing that \"every patron of the game is conversant with the utter worthlessness of the average pitcher when he goes up to try and hit.\"It wasn\\'t until 1973 that Ron Blomberg stepped in for the Yankees as the first-ever DH. This time, it was the NL that rejected the proposal, but the AL adopted it anyway.The DH has been a part of AL baseball ever since, and the NL is widely expected to adopt one starting next season.1 fun thing: Our top five DHs of all-time…Edgar MartínezDavid OrtizFrank ThomasPaul MolitorNelson CruzGo deeper: The evolution of the DH (SABR)\\xa0\\xa09. ⚾️ MLB triviaPhoto: Sean M.

Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Siemens USA CEO Barbara Humpton. Register. \\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningPhoto illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios. Photo: James Brickwood/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\\xa0Sing it with me one more time: Elliott Management gets what Elliott Management wants. Driving the news: Jack Dorsey yesterday stepped down as CEO of Twitter, nearly two years after the activist investor began pushing for his ouster. His replacement will be longtime CTO Parag Agrawal.Dorsey didn\\'t mention Elliott in his resignation memo, instead going with some stuff about how it\\'s important for companies to break free of their founders (you\\'ll never guess who founded Square, where Dorsey remains CEO).Reminder: Dorsey didn\\'t have voting control at Twitter. He does have it at Square, plus a ton more equity value and fewer political headaches. What happened: Dorsey seemed to save his skin last March when Twitter agreed to give Elliott a board seat and accept a large new investment/share repurchase agreement with private equity firm Silver Lake (which also joined the board). Behind the scenes, however, Twitter\\'s reconstructed board is said to have quickly formed a management structure committee. Twitter disclosed last November in an 8-K filing that it had \"updated the CEO succession plan in line with best practices.\" That line was intentionally vague, but it basically meant that Twitter had launched a yearlong process to replace Dorsey, the culmination of which was made public yesterday.Elliott stepped off the board earlier this year, but it continued to be involved — having signed a confidential information-sharing agreement with Twitter.The upshot is that Elliott had wanted two things: New management and an increased pace of product innovation. On the former, Dorsey is gone and there also have been changes at the chairman level. On the latter, Twitter has rolled out a series of products, including a subscription service called Blue and a Clubhouse knockoff called Spaces.The bottom line: Elliott\\'s asks often appear fanciful at first blush, whether the target is AT&T or Dell or eBay or Athenahealth or @jack. But, more often than not, its dreams become reality.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Edgewell (NYSE: EPC), the Connecticut-based maker of Schick razors, acquired DTC women\\'s razor maker Billie for $310 million in cash.Why it\\'s the BFD: This is the final move of an antitrust chess match in which Billie was a pawn. Backstory: Billie agreed in early 2020 to be acquired by Gillette owner Procter & Gamble, with lots of industry chatter that the deal was primarily designed to put regulatory pressure on Edgewell\\'s agreement to buy Harry\\'s for $1.37 billion. And it worked. Yes, P&G also got blocked by the FTC from buying Billie, but that was a small price to pay. ROI: Billie had raised $35 million in VC funding from firms like Silverton Partners, Goldman Sachs, Female Founders Fund, Lakehouse Ventures, Serena Ventures and ACME Capital.Side note: The juxtaposition of a lead item on Jack Dorsey and a second item about razors is not lost on me.The bottom line: \"Billie will continue to be led by its co-founders, Georgina Gooley and Jason Bravman .... Edgewell expects the acquisition to be slightly positive to Edgewell\\'s adjusted earnings per share during fiscal 2022. Billie plans to expand into brick-and-mortar retail next year.\" — Jonathan Roeder, Bloomberg\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Lessen, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based property services platform, raised $170 million in Series B funding at a valuation north of $1 billion.

You might be a tad surprised. 2020 was a massive shock to the system, sowouldn\\'t it make sense to see a dip from 2019 to 2020? It turns out that 2020\\'s online Black Friday sales were almost 20%higher  than2019\\'s-and while it\\'s true that shoppers were especially strapped lastyear, it\\'s also true that they spent more money online because they wereterrified of traditional brick-and-mortar shopping. Fun times.\\xa0 Then we get to this year\\'s Black Friday. Sales dipped because (A)shopping season has been spread out this year, largely due tosupply-chain issues, and (B) shoppers were no longer (as) terrified ofgiving business to brick-and-mortar stores.

They have a strategic syrup reserve for much the reason you\\'d expect:yields vary by season, and they need to have extra on hand for seasonswhere demand is outpacing supply. That\\'s happening now because (let\\'s bereal) all of us have needed to expand our breakfast hours over the pastcouple years.Final tickling detail: apparently there\\'s an organization called TheQuebec Maple Syrup Producers which is often dubbed \"the OPEC of maplesyrup,\" a phrase we never thought we\\'d read (and yet here we happilyfind ourselves). How to Use an iPad as a Second Monitor (Without Sidecar).First, the nifty context for non-techies:Macs have a new-ish feature called Sidecar, and it allows you to use aniPad as a second computer screen, wirelessly. That\\'s an awesome deskhack- especially for travel when you can\\'t bring your deskmonitor-and from what we\\'ve heard, Sidecar does work pretty well.But there are two catches: Sidecar is only a Mac thing, and it\\'s onlycompatible with newer iPad models. My ancient iPad Mini didn\\'t even comeclose to meeting the system requirements. Boooooooooo.Yet today I rejoice! For I am typing these very words on a Mac andwatching them pop into place on the ancient iPad Mini next to me... alljust because I can.  The app is called Duet Display , and it\\'sbasically Sidecar on Steroids. You can use it on Mac or Windows, you canconnect pretty much any iPad or Android tablet, and (best of all) itworks impressively well, even over wireless. It\\'s not free, but thepricing is very reasonable and you get to try it out for a week beforebilling.Cherry on Top  Through Duet Display, an iPad doesn\\'t count towardsthe M1 Macs\\' current limitation of one external display. Translation: Ihave two external displays connected to my MacBook right now (andrunning smoothly) when that\\'s not even supposed to be possible yet.HOLIDAY SAVINGS ADVICE\\xa0 DISCOUNT TIPS from TRAITOROUS MARKETERS1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Go ahead and install Honey . It\\'s abrowser extension that does the whole \"let me Google coupon codes\"thing, except way better than you can, and for free. PayPal bought Honeya couple years ago, though (fortunately) it doesn\\'t seem PayPal hasgotten too handsy with Honey\\'s way of doing things. 2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Check to see if there\\'s a discount for new customers/accounts.That\\'s pretty typical, and for good reason. Just know that, if you\\'recutthroat about keeping your inbox clean, you can just go back into yourinbox and unsubscribe the moment you\\'ve completed your order on thestore. You earn good money for that single minute of sub-coupon-unsubwork. Or you could use a \"disposable\" email service like this one.3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Deliberately abandon your cart. This is a great way to fish fordiscounts, even if the store doesn\\'t seem to be offering any. If you know you want to order stuff from a particular online store, goto that store and do three things. Just create an account (sign up withyour email), put stuff in your cart, then completely exit the store andbegin the waiting game. Cart abandonment is a quick way to get an e-commerce store payingattention to you because an abandoned cart is money that juuuuuustbarely didn\\'t make it across the finish line. They figure: if we cangive you a little \"push,\" even if we have to pay for it, it\\'ll close thesale and we\\'ll make the money back. It\\'s effectively a choice between NoSale and Sweeten The Deal.If the \"Wait Come Back\" email is gonna come, the timing may vary; itcould be a few minutes or a couple days later. But this is why youcreated an account and traded them your email: it\\'s how they follow youout the door with a better offer.4\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Look for unusual fine print on the store\\'s pages. Justyesterday, I was on the Sheex  website and Inoticed a bit of copy referencing a special TV offer. I hadn\\'t seen theTV offer on TV, but I knew that this meant \"extra discount in play.\"Sure enough, I got free shipping and two extra pillow cases ($40 value)just for clicking a fragment of promo copy I\\'d usually ignore.Honorable Mention  This was an off-the-wall suggestion, but it\\'screative and we\\'ve seen it work. Basically, if you have a brand in mind,check their Facebook Ad Library entries for discount codes, even if they\\'d be way out of date. Some ofthose codes will have been left open, even if many others have been setto expire at the right times. These overlooked, still-active couponcodes are operational minutiae, easy to overlook and hard to argue with(leaving it open closed a sale!).OH, and THIS...3 Perfectly Timed PicturesPure luck, even with hummingbird reflexesPerfectly Timed Photos are about as old as photography itself-slightlyyounger, perhaps-and in internet-shtick terms, that\\'s been a thing forabout a decade. The subreddit r/PerfectTimingwas created almostexactly 10 years ago.So the idea is not new... but fortunately, the photos keep coming.

       " 'Plus: Game of the year tonight! | Tuesday, November 30, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 30, 2021👋 Good morning! Great to be back, missed you guys.Today\\'s word count: 1,946 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🏈  College football gone madIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0In the span of two days, the head coaches of two of the biggest college football programs in America have jumped ship, wooed by even greater challenges — and the almighty dollar.Lincoln Riley\\'s USC contract is reportedly worth $110 million and he gets 24/7 access to a private jet. USC is also buying him a $6 million home in Los Angeles.Brian Kelly broke up with Notre Dame via text Monday night. He\\'s headed to LSU on a reported 10-year, $100 million deal — a week after saying he\\'d never leave South Bend.Why it matters: The college football coaching carousel has always been a theater of the absurd, from flight trackers to mysterious boosters. But there has never been a 24 hours like this one.Successful coaches at powerhouses have traditionally stayed put, \"lording over fiefdoms until they lost their winning magic or were undone by age or scandal,\" writes Yahoo Sports\\' Dan Wetzel. \"Bear. Woody. Bo. JoePa. And so on and so on. Those guys never left.\"\"That was a quaint era. This is something different, a relentless race to the perceived top where even the bluest of blue-blood programs can get poached in the flash of a new contract [and] the churn of who is going where overshadows the actual games.\" A display at the Los Angeles Coliseum welcomes Lincoln Riley to USC. Photo: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesConsider this: Notre Dame has a 58% chance of making the College Football Playoff for the third time in four seasons — and their coach just bolted without giving any warning.If the Irish do make the final four, a bunch of unpaid student-athletes will play on their sport\\'s biggest stage while their handsomely-paid coach settles into his new home 1,000 miles away.Meanwhile, USC is reportedly buying both of Riley\\'s Oklahoma homes for $500,000 over asking — a year after universities cut over 100 sports programs amid the pandemic.What to watch: Just in case Riley and Kelly earning more than most NFL coaches doesn\\'t make this look enough like a pro sport, keep an eye on the transfer portal. It\\'s basically free agency now — and could get crazy.\\xa0\\xa02. 🏀 Tonight: Game of the year in PhoenixIllustration: Axios Visuals\\xa0The Suns host the Warriors tonight in the game of the year, with Phoenix (17-3) riding a 16-game winning streak and Golden State (18-2) clearly the NBA\\'s best team so far.Tip-off: 10pm ET (TNT)Lines: Suns -2.5 | O/U: 221By the numbers:Stephen Curry has made 105 threes in 19 games this season, breaking his own record for fewest games needed to get to 100.Devin Booker was just named Western Conference Player of the Week after averaging 30 points per game on 53% FG, 56% 3PT and 90% FT.The Warriors have scored 100+ points in 43 consecutive games. The second longest active streak belongs to the Heat, with 11 straight.The Suns are 90-32 (.738) since the Disney World bubble, transforming from a fringe playoff team to a juggernaut.Who to watch: Booker and Chris Paul are studs, and Jordan Poole is breaking out (18.1 ppg). But the main attraction is Curry, who has \"entered the Roger Federer Zone,\" according to WSJ\\'s Jason Gay (subscription).It isn\\'t simply that Curry is among basketball\\'s greatest ever, or plays in an aesthetically stirring way, or is admirably sportsmanlike, or is an NBA champion multiple times over. It\\'s more of a vibe.As it was with Federer and tennis before he got hurt, there\\'s a public urgency around Curry, to drop everything to watch him play basketball, because you\\'re not quite sure you\\'ll ever see anyone play quite like this again.📆 Also tonight ... The Nets host the Knicks in a Big Apple showdown (7pm, TNT).\\xa0\\xa03. ⛳️ Tiger rules out full-time returnTiger Woods after winning the 2019 Masters. Photo: Andrew Redington/Getty Images\\xa0In his first extensive interview since his February car crash,\\xa0Tiger Woods told Golf Digest that he hopes to return to competitive golf — but that he never expects to compete full-time again.I think something that is realistic is playing the Tour one day — never full time, ever again — but pick and choose, just like Mr. [Ben] Hogan did. Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that.You practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. I think that\\'s how I\\'m going to have to play it from now on. It\\'s an unfortunate reality, but it\\'s my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it.I don\\'t have to compete and play against the best players in the world to have a great life ... I can still participate in the game of golf. If my leg gets OK, I can still click off a tournament here or there.But as far as climbing the mountain again and getting all the way to the top, I don\\'t think that\\'s a realistic expectation of me.Added Woods: \"There was a point in time when, I wouldn\\'t say it was 50/50, but it was damn near there if I was going to walk out of that hospital with one leg.\"The bottom line: Tiger hasn\\'t been a dominant, year-round force for years. But it\\'s still sobering to hear him admit that his run of greatness — the likes of which we may never see again — is essentially over.In other somber golf news ... Lee Elder, the first Black golfer to play at the Masters, has died at the age of 87. A trailblazer and an icon.\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s happening in your hometown with Axios Local newsletters.Local reporters will deliver the latest news and insights on sports, politics, and more.Subscribe for free.\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundPhoto: Patrick Smith/Getty Images\\xa0🏈 MNF recap: Kendall Fuller intercepted a two-point conversion to lift Washington (5-6) past Seattle, 17-15, and hand the Seahawks (3-8) their eighth loss for the first time in the Russell Wilson era.⚾️ Half a billion: The Rangers are the first team ever to commit half a billion dollars to two or fewer players in a single offseason, signing Corey Seager (10 years, $325M) and Marcus Semien (seven years, $175M).⚽️ Arena honored: Bruce Arena has been named MLS Coach of the Year for the fourth time. He and the top-seeded Revolution host No. 4 seed NYC FC in the East semis tonight.🏈 Injured RBs: Christian McCaffrey (ankle) is out for the year, and Dalvin Cook (torn labrum) is out indefinitely.

No. 20 Georgia and No. 24 Notre Dame are also ranked.Out: Previously unbeaten UCLA, West Virginia and Virginia Tech all dropped out.Driving the news: Gatorade has signed UConn sophomore sensation Paige Bueckers to a multi-year deal, making her its first-ever NCAA athlete partner.This is Bueckers\\' second NIL deal after inking an agreement with e-commerce platform StockX earlier this month, though coach Geno Auriemma doesn\\'t think too many more will follow.\"If Paige plays it right, there will only be two, three, or four [companies],\" he\\xa0said in October. \"But they won\\'t be getting free haircuts. They\\'ll be really big.\"Go deeper: Holiday tournament chaos (Yahoo)\\xa0\\xa07. 🌎 The world in photos Photo: Franck Fife/AFP via Getty ImagesPARIS — Lionel Messi won his record-extending seventh Ballon d\\'Or on Monday, putting him two ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, who finished outside the top three in voting for the first time since 2010.Women\\'s winner: Alexia Putellas, who also played for FC Barcelona last season, became the first Spain international to win since 1960.

Absurd.Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee (Phillies, 2011): Doc\\'s last great year saw him and Lee finish 2-3 for the Cy Young. Philly hasn\\'t won the division since.What to watch: Scherzer and deGrom have five combined Cy Youngs, including four straight from 2016 to 2019. With dominant 2022 seasons, they could join this group.Go deeper: Will the Mets new era be successful?

Photo: Charley Piringi/AFP via Getty\\xa0Three days of rioting in the Solomon Islands may have been sparked by local grievances, but there’s a clear geopolitical dimension at play and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has accused unnamed “outside powers” of stoking the unrest.The big picture: The South Pacific island country rescinded diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of China in 2019, leaving just 15 countries still recognizing Taiwan and generating domestic backlash against Sogavare.The opposition was particularly intense on the country’s most populous island, Malaita, where the provincial government defied the prime minister and maintained links with Taipei. The U.S. was accused of making a geopolitical play last year when it promised $35 million in aid directly to Malaita. Meanwhile, Sogavare has leaned into the relationship with Beijing, touting opportunities for Chinese investment.The diplomatic dispute has become another dimension of long-running tensions between the national government and Malaita over access to public resources and services.Driving the news: Protesters from Malaita gathered last Wednesday in the national capital, Honiara, on the island of Guadalcanal, demanding that \\u200b\\u200bSogavare meet with them and calling for his resignation.The protesters attempted to storm parliament and were met with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.That triggered three days of violence. Much of the looting and destruction came in Chinatown, and three charred bodies were recovered from a store there.Calm seemed to be restored by Saturday after Australia had dispatched 100 soldiers and police and \\u200b\\u200bPapua New Guinea sent 50 police officers, both at Sogavare’s request. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was careful to note that Australia was not taking sides.State of play: Sogavare has rebuffed calls to resign and said the riots were due to “deliberate lies” about the diplomatic switch and meddling from “outside powers.” That\\'s probably a reference to the U.S. and Taiwan, writes Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands Program.China’s party-run Global Times tabloid pointed the finger at both countries as well as Australia, despite the fact that Australian forces were invited in to keep the peace (the editorial cites speculation that Australia was wary of Chinese forces stepping in).Taiwan has denied any role in the uprising. The U.S. State Department expressed concerns about the violence and stressed the \"enduring ties\" between the U.S. and the Solomon Islands.Reality check: “While geopolitics may have been a spark, the true drivers of this week’s unrest go much deeper than foreign policy,” Pryke contends. They include inter-island grievances, high youth unemployment and poor government services.\\xa0\\xa02. Iran preparing to enrich weapons-grade uranium, Israel warns U.S.Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi holds a press conference. Photo: Presidency of Iran handout via Getty\\xa0Israel has shared intelligence over the past two weeks with the U.S. and several European allies suggesting that Iran is taking technical steps to prepare to enrich uranium to 90% purity — the level needed to produce a nuclear weapon, Axios\\' Barak Ravid scoops.Why it matters: Enriching to 90% would bring Iran closer than ever to the nuclear threshold. The Israeli warnings come as nuclear talks resume in Vienna, with Iran returning to the negotiating table today after a five-month hiatus.The Iranians are negotiating directly with China, France, Germany, Russia, the U.K. and EU, and indirectly with the Americans.What they\\'re saying: Iran\\'s hawkish new nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, wrote in the FT that a deal will only be possible if the U.S. is willing to \"pay a price\" for Trump\\'s withdrawal, guarantee that it won\\'t be repeated, and make the first move by removing all sanctions imposed since 2015. The Biden administration has said it will not meet those conditions.The head of the EU delegation, Enrique Mora, expressed optimism about the first day of talks and said the new Iranian government had agreed to take the previous six rounds into consideration rather than starting from scratch, but that he doesn\\'t expect any breakthrough this round.What to watch: The intelligence Israel shared with the Biden administration suggests the Iranian preparatory steps would allow Iran to move ahead with 90% enrichment within weeks if it chose to do so, according to a U.S. source.Go deeper\\xa0\\xa03. State of the outbreak: The Omicron scrambleIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Countries are closing their borders and accelerating booster rollouts to stave off the danger from the Omicron variant. State of play: Omicron’s mutations have scientists concerned that it could spread more easily than previous variants and render vaccines less effective, though it may not cause more serious illness. We won’t have a clear picture for a couple of weeks either way, but countries aren’t waiting to find out.The U.K. expanded booster access to all adults from only people over 40. Countries including the UAE are taking similar steps. The CDC now says all Americans over 18 “should” get a booster.The U.S. is among the several countries that have banned flights from southern Africa (over objections from the WHO and the region). Japan and Israel are closing their borders entirely, while Australia froze plans to ease border restrictions. Countries that had been opening to tourists may now reconsider.The WHO says the threat from the new variant underscores the need to vaccinate the world. President Biden contended today that the U.S. is doing its part but “we need the rest of the world to step up.”Worth noting: Chinese President Xi Jinping announced today that China would be donating 600 million additional doses to Africa, and providing an additional 400 million through other means. \\xa0\\xa0A message from The ONE CampaignWorld AIDS Day 2021: AIDS is still a crisis\\xa0\\xa0AIDS is not a disease of the past — it’s a crisis now.

Photo: Patrick Meinhardt/AFP via Getty\\xa0It\\'s one of the strictest vaccination policies in the world, on paper at least: To access restaurants, many businesses, public buildings or government services like public transport, adults must be fully vaccinated by Dec. 21.The twist: The policy was announced in Kenya, where just 5% of the population and 9% of adults are fully vaccinated, due primarily to a lack of supply.State of play: With supplies increasing, the government has announced a major vaccination drive starting this week and hopes the mandate will help increase the uptake.There are obvious hurdles:Even the government\\'s most optimistic timetables would see vaccinations limited to around one-third of adults by the end of the year. Vaccine certifications are to be displayed via smartphone, which millions of Kenyans lack, Soila Kenya reports in The Continent.Kenyan security forces also used violent and at times deadly force to police previous pandemic policies like curfews, The Continent notes.What to watch: Kenya\\'s health minister has conceded that enforcement may be uneven.The big picture: Other African countries have attempted partial vaccine mandates, such as for government employees in Zimbabwe and for teachers and health workers in Uganda.\\xa0\\xa05. Germany claims pipeline sanctions would be \"victory for Putin\"Photo: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\\xa0The German government has urged members of Congress not to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, arguing that doing so will \"weaken\" U.S. credibility and \"ultimately damage transatlantic unity,\" according to documents obtained by Axios\\' Zach Basu.Why it matters: The pipeline would circumvent Ukrainian transit infrastructure and deliver Russian gas directly to Germany, eliminating one of the last deterrents Ukraine has against an invasion.Context: President Biden says he opposes the pipeline, but he waived sanctions this spring in order to avoid alienating a key U.S. ally over a project that was already close to completion.Dissatisfied Senate Republicans are now pushing for new sanctions as an amendment to the annual must-pass defense bill, with a vote possible as soon as this week.Driving the news: In an attempt to reassure Congress, the German Embassy in Washington privately detailed what retaliatory action against Russia could look like in a \"non-paper,\" which is typically used in closed discussions to convey candid policy positions.A Nov. 19 document marked as \"classified\" outlines steps Germany would take at the national level, including \"strong public messages\" condemning Russia\\'s behavior, \"assessing\" the suspension of future political meetings, and reviewing \"possible\" restrictions on future Russian fossil fuel projects — not including Nord Stream 2.The paper claims that Nord Stream 2 currently presents \"no threat to Ukraine as long as reasonable gas transit is ensured,\" and it refers to potential sanctions on the pipeline as \"a victory for Putin\" because it would divide Western allies.Go deeper\\xa0\\xa06. Global news roundupCastro celebrates. Photo: Inti Ocon/Getty Images\\xa01. Xiomara Castro appears to have won a landslide victory in Honduras\\' presidential election, putting her on course to become the country\\'s first female president and first left-wing leader since her husband Manuel Zelaya was deposed in 2009.What to watch: Castro has promised to reverse corruption and democratic backsliding. She could also break with Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China.2. Magdalena Andersson was appointed as Sweden\\'s first female prime minister, resigned, and then was appointed again today, all within the space of a few days.The backstory: Andersson hoped to lead a coalition government but the Greens walked away when her budget failed to pass last week, prompting her resignation. The Social Democrat will now attempt to steer a minority government, implement the more conservative budget passed by Parliament, and hold things together until the next election in September 2022.3. The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has announced an investigation into allegations, based on leaked bank records, that former President Joseph Kabila\\'s friends and family siphoned around $138 million in public funds into private bank accounts.The backstory: Kabila took office in 2001 following his father\\'s assassination and has long been accused of using the office to enrich himself, which he denies. Since he stepped aside in 2019, the country\\'s politics have hinged on Kabila\\'s rivalry with President Felix Tshisekedi.\\xa0\\xa07. Stories we\\'re watchingCricket in Kashmir.

       " 'Plus, the next big software buyout. | Monday, November 29, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Goldman Sachs One Million Black Women\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Nov 29, 2021🚨 Breaking: Jack Dorsey is expected to step down as CEO of Twitter, as first reported by CNBC. No word on timing or who would replace Dorsey, who also leads Square.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios\\xa0Simon Clark is frustrated. The Wall Street Journal reporter is five months removed from the publication of his well-received book on Abraaj Group, a private equity pioneer turned Ponzi scheme, but tells me the industry has turned a blind eye to the cautionary tale he co-authored with Will Louch.\"The book has been widely read. I\\'ve been invited by academic institutions to talk about the issues raised, and one of the major limited partners has privately asked for a conversation. But, largely, the private equity and impact investing industries still don\\'t want to even utter the word \\'Abraaj,\\' ... ostriches with their heads in the sand, hoping to whole thing will go away.\"Backstory: Abraaj was one of the world\\'s most celebrated PE firms. Backers included the U.S. and U.K. governments. Its leader, Arif Naqvi, was a Davos regular who preached the gospel of impact investing n emerging markets; almost always with a mention of his own rags-to-riches bio, a jet-setting billionaire born of very modest means in Pakistan.Naqvi also appears to have been a crook, allegedly stealing money from Abraaj and its investors. He\\'d fill the holes he created by raising new capital, with fundraising bolstered by falsified valuations. If that failed, he\\'d surreptitiously borrow money so that Abraaj\\'s bank accounts looked \"full\" in quarterly statements sent to LPs. Naqvi\\'s con was first called by an investment officer named Andrew Farnum at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which had committed $100 million to an Abraaj healthcare fund. In short, Farnum noticed that capital calls weren\\'t being matched by actual investments, and he then caught Abraaj in a lie about where they money was being kept. Clark and Louch also played a major role, enabled by a whistleblower who was seemingly ignored by LPs.Two big takeaways from the book, a page-turner that could be stuffed into stockings:A lot of LPs fell down on the job. If Farnum found the fraud, others could have too. It\\'s a big reminder of how so much of private equity is based on trust, despite the billions of dollars at risk. The lack of other large-scale frauds may be more by luck than by design.Naqvi\\'s key insight was that many investors are uncomfortable with the amoral nature of textbook capitalism. He promised that Abraaj would make money while doing good, a combo so intoxicating that red flags were ignored.The fallout: Abraaj investors have stayed quiet, contributing to Simon Clark\\'s consternation. Some of it is surely due to embarrassment. Some is at the request of law enforcement, including American officials who have spent years trying to get Naqvi extradited from the U.K., where he\\'s under house arrest.One tangible industry change, per a source familiar, is that LPs are now paying much more attention to the individual relationships between private equity and accounting firms. There were some personal ties between Abraaj and KPMG, although the accounting giant insists that it too was defrauded.The bottom line: \"I do believe impact investing can help solve some of the world\\'s problems, so the pitch itself isn\\'t necessarily bogus,\" Clark says. \"But the bigger the promise an investor makes, the bigger the questions that should be asked of them.\"\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Brendan Lynch/Axios\\xa0Clearlake Capital Group agreed to buy Quest Software, an Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based provider of enterprise management software, from Francisco Partners for $5.4 billion (including debt).Why it\\'s the BFD: This reflects ongoing private equity bounty from Dell\\'s 2013 decision to go private, and its subsequent merger with EMC. In this case, Quest Software was born via Francisco\\'s $2.4 billion carveout in 2016 of Dell\\'s software unit, which was then split into two companies (the other, SonicWall, has been rumored to also be for sale).The bottom line: \"It is the latest big buyout in software, whose steady cash flow has become a major draw for private-equity firms, as they set their sights on bigger and bigger deals .... The price Clearlake is paying amounts to 10.9 times Quest\\'s EBITDA for the last 12 months.\" — Miriam Gottfried, WSJ \\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Armis, a Palo Alto-based asset visibility and security platform, raised $300 million from One Equity Partners at a $3.4 billion valuation. www.armis.com• Slice, an Indian digital credit card provider, raised $220 million in Series B funding at a valuation north of $1 billion.

Photo: Jeffrey Vest/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesMore Rivalry Week: The full slate of games provided plenty more intrigue than just the three games above.No. 1 Georgia 45, Georgia Tech 0: The Bulldogs are the first team since Texas in 1979 to allow 17 or fewer points in each of their first 12 games.No. 20 NC State 34, UNC 30: The Wolfpack became the first team this season to win after trailing by at least nine points with less than 2:30 to play (0-451 previously).No. 16 Iowa 28, Nebraska 21: The Cornhuskers are the first team in FBS history with nine single-digit losses in a season. Brutal.Minnesota 23, No. 14 Wisconsin 13: After losing 14 straight meetings, the Golden Gophers have won two of the past four Battles for Paul Bunyan\\'s Axe — college football\\'s most-played rivalry (131 meetings).What\\'s next: Conference championship matchups are set. Depending how they play out, it\\'s possible that Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and Ohio State — who\\'ve combined for 20 of the 28 CFP spots — will all miss the playoff.SEC: No. 1 Georgia vs. No. 3 AlabamaBig Ten: No. 5 Michigan vs. No. 16 IowaBig 12: No. 7 Oklahoma State vs. No. 8 BaylorACC: No. 17 Pittsburgh vs. No. 18 Wake ForestPac-12: No. 11 Oregon vs. No. 19 UtahAmerican: No. 24 Houston at No. 4 CincinnatiC-USA: Western Kentucky at No. 22 UTSAMAC: Northern Illinois vs. Kent StateSun Belt: Appalachian State at LouisianaMountain West: Utah State at No. 21 San Diego State\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL Sunday: Deebo does it allPhoto: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\\xa049ers WR Deebo Samuel has become the inverse of Christian McCaffrey — a receiver so dynamic his coach can\\'t help but call run plays for him.In his past three games, Samuel — whose 1,006 receiving yards are fourth-most in the league — has rushed 19 times for 181 yards and 4 TD, including two on Sunday.He\\'s the first WR in the Super Bowl era with a rushing TD in three straight games, and the third player in NFL history with 1,000+ receiving yards, 5+ receiving TD and 5+ rushing TD in the same season.These superlative efforts haven\\'t all been for naught, either, as the 49ers (6-5) have won three in a row and moved into the NFC\\'s No. 6 seed.Notes:Like father, like son: Broncos rookie CB Patrick Surtain II scored his first career TD on a pick-six Sunday in Denver. His father, Dolphins CB Patrick Surtain, scored his last career TD on a pick-six in Denver 19 years ago.Leonard FOURnette: Playoff Lenny arrived early this year, putting the Bucs on his back with a career-high 4 TD in Tampa\\'s nail-biting win over the Colts.The tide is turning: Cincinnati decimated Pittsburgh, 41-10, sweeping the season series for the first time in 12 years and dropping the Steelers to the AFC North basement.AFC East goes streaking: The Patriots (8-4) have won six straight ... the Dolphins (5-7) have won four straight, and the playoffs are no longer an unrealistic goal in Miami.A win\\'s a win: Lamar Jackson became the first QB since Andy Dalton in 2013 to throw four picks and still get the win, as the Ravens (8-3) beat the Browns, 16-10, and held onto the AFC\\'s No. 1 seed.📆\\xa0Tonight ... Seattle at Washington (8:15pm ET, ESPN)\\xa0\\xa03. ⚾️ The stove is turned all the way upIllustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios\\xa0MLB\\'s hot stove went from warm to scalding on a Sunday that saw five teams dish out $558 million worth of contracts to seven players.Rangers ($231M): 2B/SS Marcus Semien (seven years, $175M) and RHP Jon Gray (four years, $56M) — Texas, which hasn\\'t made the playoffs since 2016, is trying to buy its way out of the doldrums.Blue Jays ($110M): RHP Kevin Gausman (five years, $110M) — The Jays won 91 games last season but missed the playoffs. Between this and the huge extension with RHP José Berríos earlier this month, it appears they\\'re going all in. Marlins ($109M): RF Avisail García (four years, $53M) and RHP Sandy Alcántara (five years, $56M) — García\\'s a decent free agent pickup, but extending Alcántara, their budding ace, could pay huge dividends.Twins ($100M): CF Byron Buxton (seven years, $100M) — This extension would have been far higher with a better health track record, but he\\'s exceeded 100 games just once in seven seasons. Hence, the unprecedented incentives.Rays ($8M): RHP Corey Kluber (one year, $8M) — The 35-year-old, two-time Cy Young winner got hurt last year, but was effective when healthy (3.83 ERA in 80 IP).The big picture: With the CBA expiring Wednesday at midnight and a lockout expected, there\\'s reason to believe this is just the beginning of a league-wide spending sprint.The next domino to fall could be Max Scherzer, who\\'s reportedly close to finalizing a multiyear deal with the Mets.Go deeper: Free-agency tracker (ESPN)\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s happening in your hometown with Axios Local newsletters.Local reporters will deliver the latest news and insights on sports, politics, and more.Subscribe for free.\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundPhoto: Joe Klamar/AFP via Getty Images\\xa0🎾\\xa0Davis Cup: Novak Djokovic\\'s Serbia was the final team to advance to the Davis Cup quarterfinals, which begin today across Europe.

Before 2018, the only other time the Azzurri failed to qualify was in 1958.Portugal hasn\\'t missed the World Cup since 1998, and Cristiano Ronaldo is a perfect three-for-three in major tournament playoffs (2010 and 2014 World Cups; Euro 2012).How it works: 12 teams were drawn into three groups, or paths, of four. The winner of each path — comprising single-elimination semis and finals being played next March — qualifies for the World Cup.Path A: Scotland vs. Ukraine; Wales vs. AustriaPath B: Russia vs. Poland; Sweden vs. Czech RepublicPath C: Italy vs. North Macedonia; Portugal vs. TurkeyGo deeper: Final World Cup spots around the world (Sporting News)\\xa0\\xa06. 🇺🇸 Photos across America Photo: Gregory Shamus/Getty ImagesKILLINGTON, Vt. — Mikaela Shiffrin recorded her 46th career World Cup win in slalom, tying a 32-year-old record for most all-time in a single discipline.🎥 Watch: Highlights (YouTube)  Photo: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesLOS ANGELES — With seven more threes on Sunday, Steph Curry reached 105 on the season, passing his own record from 2015-16 (102) for the most-ever through a team\\'s first 20 games.Dubs on top: The Warriors also won again, giving them the best record by any team through 20 games (18-2) since that same 2015-16 Warriors team (20-0).

Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images\\xa087 years ago today, the Bears beat the Lions on Thanksgiving Day, 19-16, in the first-ever nationally broadcast NFL game.The backdrop: Detroit radio executive George Richards in 1934 bought the four-year-old Portsmouth Spartans, moved them from Ohio to the Motor City and changed their name to the Lions.Richards knew he\\'d need to make a splash in that inaugural season in Detroit, so he convinced George Halas to bring his two-time reigning champ Chicago Bears to town for a game on Thanksgiving morning.To up the ante, he contacted NBC radio and persuaded them to make history, broadcasting the game on their 94-station national network.The big picture: Chicago won the battle, but the Lions won the war, drawing their first sellout crowd of the season and beginning a tradition that remains to this day.Every year since (aside from World War II), Detroit has hosted a game on Thanksgiving. Their record even looked pretty good until this century, but a 6-16 mark since 2000 has dropped them to 37-43-2 all time.🎧\\xa0Listen: The history of football on Thanksgiving (Legendary Bites)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏒 NHL triviaPhoto: Norm Hall/NHLI via Getty Images\\xa0Oilers superstar Leon Draisaitl scored his 20th goal Wednesday in just his 19th game, becoming the fastest player to reach 20 goals since the 1995-96 season.Question: Who was that player 26 years ago?Hint: Not Wayne GretzkyAnswer at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa010. 🎥 Top plays: Weekend editionPhoto: David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images\\xa0🏀\\xa0This should have counted⚽️ Vinicius Junior!🏈\\xa0Marvin Jones Jr.!⚽️ Thiago Alcántara!🏈\\xa0Jaxon Smith-Njigba!🏀\\xa0Steph doesn\\'t just shoot🏈\\xa0Lamar to Andrews🏀\\xa0With AUTHORITY🏀\\xa0Dayton at the buzzer!🏈\\xa0One hand, in the snowWatch all 10.\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s happening in your hometown with Axios Local newsletters.Local reporters will deliver the latest news and insights on sports, politics, and more.Subscribe for free.\\xa0Talk tomorrow,Jeff \"Ready to accept a nine-figure deal\" TracyTrivia answer: Mario Lemieux (18 games)🙏 Thanks for reading.\\xa0For more sports coverage, follow us on Twitter: @kendallbaker and\\xa0@jeffreytracy.Like this email style and format?

       " 'Plus: Robots for Black Friday | Wednesday, November 24, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By ForgeRock\\xa0Axios FutureByBryan Walsh·Nov 24, 2021Welcome to Axios Future, where I\\'m thankful for all of my subscribers, including the one who didn\\'t like the James Bond piece.If you haven\\'t subscribed, give yourself a holiday gift.Send feedback, tips and soybean-based Thanksgiving ideas (see item No. 6) to bryan.walsh@axios.com.Today\\'s Smart Brevity count: 1,451 words or about 5½ minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Why more Americans are going childlessIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0A Pew survey late last week found that 44% of Americans between 18 and 49 who aren\\'t parents say it is not too likely or not at all likely that they will have children.That\\'s an increase of 7 percentage points from 2018.Why it matters: The shift could lead to smaller family Thanksgiving dinners and major social and economic changes, as children become rarer in many parts of the country and more American adults reach old age with little to no family to support them.By the numbers: The effect of greater childlessness is being felt in U.S. fertility numbers, which were already at a record low before 2020 and have continued to drop during the pandemic. \"[T]he main cause of declining fertility in America is increasing childlessness at all ages\" rather than declining second or third births, writes Lyman Stone, a research fellow at the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).More adults are reaching retirement age without children, and increasingly without a partner.Data released by the Census Bureau this year found that 19.6% of Americans between 55 and 64 reported being childless, compared to 15.9% of those 65–74 and 10.9% of those over 75.The big picture: Most of those in the Pew survey who report they\\'re unlikely to have kids say the reason is that they just don\\'t want to have children. But Americans, in general, have also become more interested in smaller families.Data from Gallup polls find that Americans\\' ideal number of kids has fallen from around 3.5 in the 1930s to 2.5 today. And that\\'s still well above the current actual level of 1.7 lifetime births per woman.Fears about the environment, supposed overpopulation and the general state of the world have been getting a lot of press. Yes, but: Just 5% of expected non-parents in the Pew survey cited environmental reasons, a figure that is largely unchanged from earlier surveys.What they\\'re saying: Much of the increase in childlessness is a result of what Stone calls \"stage of life reasons,\" including declining rates of marriage and coupling.Another factor is the perception among many Americans that modern parenting is particularly time- and labor-intensive, which means that choosing to have children means forgoing leisure and work.What to watch: There\\'s a growing political and cultural division in the U.S. over family size.While religious Americans have long tended to get married earlier and have more children than secular Americans, the differences were much smaller in the 1970s and \\'80s than since 2000.The bottom line: Whether it\\'s right to bring a child into the world is an individual decision, but one that is highly influenced by changing social attitudes — in either direction.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. How to program biology like a computerIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0The growing synthetic biology industry is developing tools to allow companies to program living cells the way we program computers.Why it matters: Turning cellular engineering from an art to an industry could open the door to more sustainable energy, food and materials, but it carries the risk of making it much easier to create the biological equivalent of malware.What\\'s happening: Earlier this month, the leading synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks launched a Cell Development Kit (CDK) service for companies that want easy access to its biological engineering services.Like much in the synthetic biology world, the name is directly taken from the computer world — tech companies have long offered software development kits that make it easier for people to build and test computer programs.How it works: Biological engineering has long been slow and laborious — think rows of postgraduate students pipetting liquids by hand in a lab. But Ginkgo says its CDKs will streamline the process.A customer like Motif FoodWorks — a Boston-based startup that makes ingredients for plant-based meat and dairy — can use a CDK to have Gingko rapidly engineer the necessary microbes in its automated biological foundry. \"They can focus on product development rather than hiring a bunch of biologists to build DNA by hand,\" which helps them get to market faster, says Patrick Boyle, the head of codebase at Ginkgo.The catch: Should the company\\'s approach become successful, it will come with biosecurity risks. Drew Endy, a bioengineer at Stanford University, told the NY Times we should assume that in the near future, \"anyone, anywhere can make any virus from scratch.\"Yes, but: Boyle says Ginkgo is building biosecurity into its platform, in part by using automated tools that can scan synthesized DNA orders for potentially dangerous strains.

Credit: Nimble RoboticsAs more of our goods and gifts are being purchased online, robots are set to play a bigger role in e-commerce warehouses.Why it matters: With retailers struggling to meet the demand for workers in a tight labor market, smarter robots that can adapt to the often chaotic conditions of a warehouse could help close the gap. When you place an online order this holiday season, it will need to be fulfilled by a retailer, which means that good has to be physically picked and packed at a warehouse.It\\'s usually been humans doing the work — as of August, nearly 150,000 more people were employed in e-commerce warehouses than before the pandemic. Yes, but: Retailers — especially brick-and-mortar companies that are moving increasing amounts of their business to e-commerce — are having trouble finding enough workers, opening the door to automation.How it works: Nimble Robotics is using computer vision-enabled AI — and human helpers — to train robots to pick and pack a wide variety of e-commerce goods.\"We use an algorithm called imitation learning, where you use a human to remotely operate a robot to accomplish a certain task,\" says Simon Kalouche, Nimble\\'s founder and CEO. \"If you do this hundreds or thousands of times over various tasks, you can train a neural network to say, \\'I\\'ve seen this and I know how to pick it up.\\'\"Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from ForgeRockEnterprise grade identity at internet scale\\xa0\\xa0ForgeRock delivers what enterprises need to provide safe and seamless experiences to engage customers and keep employees productive to grow their businesses.What this means: The company’s software can be a game changer for your access management strategy.See how ForgeRock can help you.\\xa0\\xa04. NASA probe launches on mission to redirect an asteroidPhoto: NASA\\xa0A NASA spacecraft called DART — short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test — launched early Wednesday morning on a journey to change the orbit of an asteroid in deep space, writes Axios Space author Miriam Kramer.Why it matters: The mission is designed to test technology that could one day be used to change the course of a dangerous asteroid if one is ever found on a collision course with Earth.How it works: DART is now on its way to its target — a small asteroid \"moonlet\" called Dimorphos in orbit around a larger asteroid called Didymos.The two asteroids aren\\'t in danger of impacting Earth, but this mission will test whether the technology can shift the orbit of an asteroid just slightly to throw it off course.DART is expected to slam into Dimorphos in fall 2022.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa05.

Photo: Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post via Getty Images\\xa0A soybean-based Thanksgiving dinner would cost nearly three times less per pound and provide almost twice as much protein as a turkey-based one.Why it matters: If you want to maximize your budget on Thanksgiving — as well as the lifespan of turkeys — soybean-based Tofurky may be the way to go.By the numbers: The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis calculated that between 1990 and now, the average global price of turkey has been six times higher than the price of soybeans. As of the third quarter of 2021, a Thanksgiving dinner serving of turkey cost $1.42, while a Tofurky dinner with the same number of calories would cost $0.66.The catch: Beyond the, uh, taste differentials, your Tofurky Thanksgiving meal will be almost three times larger by weight because roasted turkey has almost three times the caloric value of an equivalent serving of roasted tofu.That would \"either keep you at the dinner table longer or provide you with more leftovers,\" the bank writes in a blog post.The bottom line: Unless you\\'re a hardcore vegan, maybe keep any Fed economists far away from your Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.\\xa0\\xa0A message from ForgeRockEnterprise grade identity at internet scale\\xa0\\xa0ForgeRock delivers what enterprises need to provide safe and seamless experiences to engage customers and keep employees productive to grow their businesses.What this means: The company’s software can be a game changer for your access management strategy.See how ForgeRock can help you.\\xa0Like this email style and format?

To be clear: he\\'s earned our respect, enough that we\\'ll be reviewing hispoints in the segment below. Also, to be fair: introductions are hard.They just are.But goodness gracious, Mr. Welbourne was definitely driving the StruggleBus for this one. The first sentence is proof all by itself. Still, the second sentence is the dead giveaway here-because a largenumber of Google results doesn\\'t tell you s**t about your query, and ithasn\\'t for a very long time now.Copywriters know this, but we can willfully ignore it if the clock\\'sticking and we run out of ideas or energy. And you know what? That\\'sokay. Better luck next time.CLIKK THIS... Five Misconceptions About Content Marketing.With that jocular tangent behind us again, we\\'ll quickly state themisconceptions (in bold) and their accompanying course corrections:1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Content marketing is only useful for \"creative\" industries, notin formal sectors. By this logic, pictures would only be useful for\"visual\" industries when, of course, pictures are everywhere and rightlyso. When we say content marketing, we\\'re really talking about marketingthat uses information and solutions;\\xa0people need those no matter theindustry. 2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Content marketing is only successful when you can consistentlyproduce large volumes of content. This is one of thosequality-over-quantity situations. Ask yourself: would you rather haveten tons of rock or a single brick of solid gold? We rest our case. 3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Your content-marketing efforts are complete when you hitPublish. Oh child, no. You\\'re not Kevin Costner and this ain\\'t Field ofDreams, where they\\'ll come just because you build it. Like anythingelse, content marketing requires follow-through. More broadly, itrequires cyclical thinking and an acceptance that you never \"get to thefinish line\" or \"save up enough content to retire.\"\\xa0\\xa04\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 The importance/value of video content is overblown, especiallyfor certain brands. Nope. Video is great. We\\'re not saying that ALL ofyour content should be in video form, but video has at least twouniversal advantages: (A) it grabs and holds attention by providing aricher sensory AV experience, and (B) videos are especially rich forbreaking down into smaller useful pieces efficiently.5\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Content marketing doesn\\'t have any impact on revenue or \"thebottom line.\" It can be difficult to measure, sure-especially whencompared to digital advertising, whose Input vs. Output is enviablyclear and concrete. But the lack of clear attribution (\"I bought thething specifically because of your blog post\") doesn\\'t mean that contentdoesn\\'t play as vital a role as other marketing disciplines.SPONSORED BY MentionDesign Yourself a Spiffy Email Signaturewith Mention\\'s Free GeneratorWe\\'re betting you don\\'t notice your own email signature anymore.That is, if you even have one.But here\\'s what you should notice about it:1\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3\\xa0\\xa0You don\\'t see your email signature because it\\'s yours.You\\'ve seen it a million times and you already know your own name.\\xa0\\xa02\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Other people, however, DO see your email signature-much thesame way you can see theirs-and it does leave an impression.

Today\\'s special edition examines the state of women\\'s soccer in America. Hope you enjoy.Note: We\\'ll be off the rest of the week. See you back here Monday.Today\\'s word count: 1,965 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Women\\'s soccer stares down changeIllustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios\\xa0The next few months could be among the most important in American women\\'s soccer history, with significant change on the horizon for both the NWSL and USWNT.State of play: Collective bargaining agreements tend to be tedious, and lawsuits can drag on. But as 2022 approaches, that\\'s where the action is.The NWSLPA will negotiate its first-ever CBA this offseason, which comes on the heels of a scandal-ridden campaign that exposed the need for cultural and structural change.The USWNT is also negotiating a new CBA, all while remaining at the forefront of a global push for gender pay equity. The team\\'s 2019 discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer is still ongoing.The backdrop: Interest in women\\'s sports has been on the rise for years, and there\\'s a sense that we\\'ve reached a turning point.Ratings are up, coverage is increasing, female athletes are commanding more attention and sponsors are spending more money.\"The stakeholders on the commercial side of sports are constantly searching for the next frontier,\" Dan Cohen of Octagon Sports told WashPost. \"It is clearly women\\'s sports.\"The big picture: As the NWSL and USWNT players pursue transformative change, both on and off the field, they can set a new standard for women\\'s sports — not just in America but around the world.The last word: \"The idea that women athletes are expected to just be appreciative that they have an opportunity ... we\\'re past that point,\" Cheryl Cooky, editor of the Sociology of Sports Journal, told Axios.\\xa0\\xa02. NWSL: A reckoning, and an offseason of changePhoto: Roy K. Miller/ISI Photos/Getty Images\\xa0Saturday\\'s NWSL title game featured 138 minutes of brilliant soccer between two teams — the Washington Spirit and Chicago Red Stars — who are now searching for new head coaches, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Richie Burke (Spirit) was fired in September after an investigation into allegations of harassment and a toxic culture.Rory Dames (Red Stars) resigned Monday amid accusations of verbal and emotional abuse by several players.Why it matters: The championship was a microcosm of the NWSL\\'s ninth season, which combined superlative play on the field with institutional failures off of it.The backdrop: In April, at the behest of players, the league introduced an anti-harassment policy to help ensure a safe work environment. The move proved to be monumentally impactful and long overdue.The situation came to a head in September, when a report detailed now-former North Carolina Courage coach Paul Riley\\'s history of sexual coercion, leading to postponed games and moments of silence.Five coaches and a GM either resigned or were fired as a result of the new policy, which gave players a formal avenue to report abuse. Then-commissioner Lisa Baird also resigned in the wake of the scandal. The big picture: The NWSL entering year 10 is no small feat, given its predecessors, the WUSA and WPS, lasted just three years each. Now, the league and its players hope to lay the foundation for the future.The ongoing investigation into the flood of accusations is the first priority, which could bleed into the offseason and perhaps beyond.The NWSLPA and NWSL are negotiating their first-ever CBA with things like increased salaries and free agency in mind.The league will grow to 12 teams next season with new clubs in San Diego and Los Angeles, the latter of which has a female-led ownership model that could shape the future of women\\'s sports.Sponsorship is leveling up, with Nike recently signing the largest commercial agreement in NWSL history. Similar deals could follow as viewership continues to rise.The owners of the NWSL\\'s Kansas City team are building a $70 million stadium on the city\\'s waterfront, which will be the world\\'s first  top-division soccer stadium constructed for a women\\'s team.The bottom line: The most tumultuous season in league history has set the stage for a new era.\\xa0\\xa03. Stat du jour: PerspectiveKelley O\\'Hara\\'s championship-clinching goal.

USWNT: A new CBA, and an equal pay fightIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The USWNT and USMNT are currently negotiating new CBAs as well, with the men\\'s already expired and the women\\'s expiring on Dec. 31.State of play: The U.S. Soccer Federation announced in September that it had offered both teams the same proposal in an effort to align them under a single CBA. Complicating things is that the men and women have long had different priorities.The men earn most of their money from club soccer, so their most recent CBA focused on higher match fees and bonuses (aka \"pay-to-play\").The women — who earn far less as pros — desire more financial security, so their current CBA has higher guaranteed salaries and more benefits.Between the lines: While U.S. Soccer can decide how money is funneled to its national teams, it has no control over the elephant in the room: FIFA\\'s World Cup prize money, which differs drastically for men and women.France\\'s soccer federation was paid $38 million from a $400 million prize pool after its men\\'s team won the 2018 World Cup.A year later, U.S. Soccer was paid $4 million from a $30 million pot after the USWNT won the Women\\'s World Cup.The backdrop: In addition to World Cup prize money, the USWNT\\'s equal pay lawsuit also hangs over negotiations.Players sued U.S. Soccer in March 2019, contending they had not been paid equitably compared to the men, and asking for more than $64 million in damages.A federal judge threw out the pay claim in May 2020, ruling the women rejected a pay-to-play structure similar to the men\\'s in favor of the one they received (higher base salaries, etc.).U.S. Soccer claims the women were actually paid more than the men from 2010-18. Of course, that\\'s because the women won two World Cups, while the men won one game in 2014 and missed 2018 entirely.What\\'s next: The USWNT players have appealed the decision, and a three-judge panel is likely to hear oral arguments in the coming months.The bottom line: U.S. Soccer is negotiating its future, while battling in court over its past.\\xa0\\xa05. Interview: Cindy Parlow ConePhoto: Meg Oliphant/Getty Images\\xa0I spoke with Cindy Parlow Cone, the president of U.S. Soccer (and former USWNT star), about the ongoing CBA negotiations and equal pay lawsuit.There\\'s a lot going on right now. Where do things stand at the U.S. Soccer Federation?It\\'s an unprecedented time. I don\\'t know of another organization negotiating two CBAs simultaneously, while also trying to resolve litigation. At the same time, we\\'re undergoing changes in our business structure and bringing our media rights back in. So it\\'s certainly an interesting time at U.S. Soccer.The equal pay debate has largely been framed as USWNT vs. USSF. Is that accurate? Or is U.S. Soccer\\'s stance misunderstood?This is not the women\\'s team vs. the federation. We\\'re on the same side, and the sooner people realize that, the better off we\\'ll be. We believe in equal pay and would love the opportunity to hook arms with the USWNT and work towards equalizing not only the FIFA World Cup prize money, but overall investment in the women\\'s game.What\\'s keeping that from happening? What\\'s the biggest challenge in the quest for equal pay?The FIFA World Cup prize money is the biggest hurdle, because that\\'s where the massive difference in pay is. I think FIFA will get there, but until they do, we\\'ve told the men\\'s and women\\'s players\\' associations that we\\'re not signing a CBA unless we all come to terms on how we\\'re going to equalize the prize money [on our end].In September, the federation announced that it had offered the men and women identical contracts. Can you speak to that?We would love to have both teams under the same contract. We know there may be small differences because the women want something the men don\\'t want and vice versa ... But having them in the same room, understanding what each side wants and is being offered will hopefully get us to the point where both players\\' associations say \"this is equal.\"Is true \"equal\" pay even possible given the differences between the men\\'s and women\\'s games?Yeah, you bring up some of the complexities of getting to an agreement. How do you make pay equal for two teams that compete against different teams, in different countries, on different schedules, in different tournaments, with different pay structures? It\\'s challenging, but we have to find a structure that works for everyone.One potential solution to the FIFA prize money problem is the men voluntarily taking less money so the women get more. Is that what needs to happen?I feel like every advancement a woman has made throughout history, they have needed male advocates. You look through our history and the history of other countries, and you see that time and time again. The majority has to look out for the minorities, and this is another case of that.\\xa0\\xa06. Exclusive poll: America\\'s teamData: Axios/Momentive poll; Chart: Thomas Oide/AxiosNo matter how you slice it, more Americans can name at least one player on the USWNT than on the USMNT, per a recent Axios/Momentive poll, Jeff writes.By the numbers: Overall, 32% of the 2,689 respondents could name at least one USWNT member, while 26% could name at least one USMNT member.Among those who closely follow sports: USWNT (56%) vs. USMNT (45%)Among men: USWNT (37%) vs. USMNT (29%)The big picture: This isn\\'t all that surprising given the women\\'s recent run of success and the men\\'s recent run of failure. The men could close the gap next year, assuming they make the World Cup.Of note: The difference in recognition and celebrity status extends to Instagram, where the USWNT also takes the cake.The top three most-followed women (Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz) have 12.7 million followers.The top three most-followed men (Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest) have 7.7 million.\\xa0\\xa07. Looking ahead: The next generationTable: Axios VisualsThe USWNT roster for a pair of friendlies against Australia this month offers a glimpse of the future, Jeff writes.By the numbers: Just 10 of the 22 players headed to Australia were on the Tokyo 2020 team. The other 12 all have 10 or fewer caps.The most notable absences are Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, left off to give younger players more experience, plus Carli Lloyd, who retired last month.Other big names missing: Alyssa Naeher, Crystal Dunn, Kelley O\\'Hara, Julie Ertz, Christen Press, Tobin Heath and Sam Mewis, absent for reasons ranging from injuries to opt outs.The big picture: While plenty of veterans will play in the 2023 World Cup, the young squad headed to Australia is a reminder that the USWNT is nearing a state of transition.One generation will soon depart, while another takes its place — a reality for all national teams.Yes, but: Few groups accomplished more on the field — or fought for more off of it — than the generation currently leading the USWNT.The bottom line: As the equal pay saga continues, it\\'s worth remembering that many of the players fighting for a better future may only get to enjoy it from the sidelines.\\xa0\\xa08. 📆 November 1991: The first Women\\'s World CupJulie Foudy (L), Michelle Akers-Stahl and Carin Jennings after winning the 1991 Women\\'s World Cup.

       " 'Plus, big bucks metaverse. | Tuesday, November 23, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Blackstone\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Nov 23, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Jonathan Bush sounded improbably chipper when we spoke, in the wake of yesterday\\'s news that Athenahealth would be sold for $17 billion by the activist hedge fund that had forced him out of the company he founded. \"I knew you\\'d be calling, so I picked an unnecessary argument with my wife to get it all out first,\" he said, after I remarked on his comportment.That\\'s always been Jonathan Bush. Unconventional. Heart worn bluntly on his sleeve. And, in the mind of Paul Singer and some other investors, the right man to start a health-tech company and the wrong man to lead it once mature.Backstory: Athenahealth was an early winner in the digitization of health records and billing, founded in 1997 and going public a decade later.Both the company and Bush were also the occasional targets of short-sellers, including David Einhorn. When revenue growth slowed in the late aughts, and the stock price stagnated, Singer\\'s Elliott Management took aim. Months after getting the cold shoulder from Athenahealth\\'s board, which by early 2018 would be chaired by former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, Elliott went hostile. Reports of Bush acting inappropriately at work and at home began to surface, some based on old court documents, with rampant speculation that Elliott was slamming its steel-toed boot on the scale (this was shortly after allegations that Elliott had used private investigators in a different campaign).Bush stepped down. Elliott and private equity firm Veritas Capital took Athenahealth private in 2018 for $5.7 billion, which was less than the $6.5 billion it originally offered. Bush called it \"a steal.\" Fast forward: Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman, both of which kicked the tires back in 2018, agreed to buy Athenahealth for $17 billion. Elliott and Veritas will retain minority stakes, with a source saying their combined position is expected to be worth just under $1 billion.Athenahealth is now almost as valuable as Cerner, one of the two dominant hospital EHR vendors alongside Epic Systems. The buyers\\' basic thesis is that the total addressable market is massive and still growing, particularly for independent docs, which means they can succeed as a top contender.It\\'s the second mega-buyout of a health-tech company in 2021 for Hellman & Friedman, which was part of the $30 billion takeover of Medline. In other words, it knows how to find the financing and is one of few firms (along with Bain) that could write this sort of check.Bush went on to found another startup called Zus Health, which recently raised Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz.Elliott pulled the old private equity playbook of tearing down to build back up. It sold Athenahealth\\'s campus for $525 million and wound down some ancillary efforts to focus on organic growth of its core business. Today, its revenue and headcount are significantly higher than they were in 2018.Bush says he respects Bain and H&F, but remains disappointed by how things went down with Elliott: \"They behaved in a very bad way and profited from it. It\\'s not about them really — blame not the bird of prey — but that regular shareholders weren\\'t the ones who got the gains.\"Elliott\\'s retort, of course, would be that shareholders weren\\'t getting gains under Bush (though he quit before the buyout, so round and round the rhetoric can go.).The bottom line: This new deal represents a new chapter in the Athenahealth story, but not the final one. \\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyNiantic, an S.F.-based maker of augmented reality games like \"Pokémon Go,\" raised $300 million from Coatue at a $9 billion valuation. Why it\\'s the BFD: This is about the metaverse that Meta isn\\'t interested in building.History: Niantic previously raised $480 million, most recently in 2019 at a $4 billion post-money valuation. Existing backers include Alsop Louie Partners, Javelin Venture Partners, CapitalG, IVP and Spark Capital.The bottom line: \"Niantic\\'s vision is the world we already\\xa0see around us, but with a digital overlay on top of it. Not a virtual world that people immerse themselves in with VR goggles or by way of a video game world like \\'Fortnite.\\' Some of Niantic\\'s recent games have struggled, but\\xa0over a billion downloads of \\'Pokémon Go\\' make a strong case that it may be the ones to figure this all out. — Stephen Totilo, Axios Gaming\\xa0\\xa0Axios Pro PreviewAuthentic Brands Group, the brand management firm whose portfolio includes Forever21, Reebok and Sports Illustrated, yesterday said that CVC Capital Partners and HPS Investment Partners would acquire minority stakes at a $12.7 billion valuation.What ABG didn\\'t say was that the investment size was $3.5 billion, including some secondary, or that its pro forma EBITDA is $745 million.

PLUS: five previews of what theCLIKK\\'ll do before the end of 2021.But first...an EYE-CATCHING HEADLINE\\xa0  Thank you, Apple Insider,for another reminder that we live in strange times. A hundred years ago, the headline above would\\'ve read like witchcraft(even for the Roaring Twenties), yet you understood it perfectly fine.History doesn\\'t usually progress quite this fast, but here we are now. Stranger still, the swallowing of AirPods is starting to become a commonheadline. It\\'s not even the first of its kind in theCLIKK.Sigh. CLIKK THIS... If You Want to Get More People to Help You, Try This.First, props: the author here is Justin Pot and he\\'s a talented staffwriter for Zapier. We\\'re happy to see his circulation growing, in thiscase via Fast Company, one of our regular sources for light reading.(\"Light\" because Fast Company often sounds like that one middle managerwho\\'s competent, but also weirdly obsessed with topics like EQ and theMyers-Briggs. Regardless, this article does fit the Fast Co ethos.)Mr. Pot\\'s guidance here is straightforward: If you want people to helpyou, don\\'t f**king yell at them. We added the expletive because it seemslike a necessary intensifier for anyone who needs that lesson in thefirst place-and if it were us, we\\'d want to dispense this advice inthe same point-blank way Fletcher Reede dispenses legal advice in LiarLiar:Which means we\\'d instantly become hypocrites, but... not the point. The point is that, 99% of the time, yelling doesn\\'t get you what youwant and, even when it does, it costs you something you don\\'t see. Allthe while, you\\'re just being an asshole-and it\\'s practically a law ofnature that the Asshole Tax will (eventually) come due whether you\\'reready to pay it or not. As a final bonus, Mr. Pot makes a sly reference to his solid post onimposter syndromeand ties the points together in a pleasingly substantial way.SPONSORED BY MentionDesign Yourself a Spiffy Email Signaturewith Mention\\'s Free GeneratorWe\\'re betting you don\\'t notice your own email signature anymore.That is, if you even have one.

In other words: they only care that you fix the issue, andif you do, they re-assess and move on like nothing ever happened. If this isn\\'t perfectly intuitive, it might be because the (human)notion of \"trust\" gets in the way. Our brains are hyper-sensitive to therelationship between Past Behavior and Present Expectations; we don\\'teasily forget what others have done to us, and we know the same is truein reverse. It complicates things for humans but, fortunately, theGooglebrain doesn\\'t exactly think this way. Newer SEOs sometimes think of technical issues as though they\\'rebruising Google\\'s trust - like oh God oh God should I apologize? -and meanwhile, the Googlebrain is just circling around the internet likethe Verizon Guy going \"can you show me now? Good!\" Target Closing for Thanksgiving...For Good.In other words, they\\'re not just closing for Thanksgiving 2021; they\\'resetting a new precedent for Thanksgivings going forward.One of 2020\\'s revelations (an accidental finding due to COVIDprecautions) was that consumers were greatly relieved to see holidaypromos starting earlier, thereby taking pressure off of major shoppingblitzes like Black Friday. A lot of retailers are wisely choosing tospare our nerves and repeat their tactics.In case the cynics are wondering: yes, Target had a profit motive aswell as a humanitarian one. Turns out that, when people aren\\'t panickedabout buying stuff in a short window, they buy more of it in the longhaul. Fair enough, Targèt. Apple Might Scrap the \\'MacBook Air\\' Name Next Year.They should. The name doesn\\'t really make sense anymore. It made sense at first. The first MacBook Airs were precariouslywaifish; like, the Pro was already lean and svelte, but the first Airwas so thin that I was nervous to rest my wrists on it while typing.This noticeable difference was possible because they were differentcomputers inside and out. But in this new M1 era, literally all of the core hardware is the sameacross Air and Pro, and the only differences are peripherals likewebcams and microphones. The new M1 Air feels a lot more like the Pro Itraded in for it-which is not a complaint, but an observation of howthe Air has outgrown its origins.So what will Apple do with the name? They\\'ll probably just changeMacBook Air to regular ol\\' MacBook. It\\'s cleaner.\\\\u261d\\\\ufe0f Spotify\\'s Play Button Stops Shuffling, Apparently Because AdeleSaid So.That\\'s the verbatim headline from The Verge, it\\'s a good summary of theinformation, and it\\'s how we\\'d\\'ve wanted to phrase it. Well played, Ms.Roth.The headline, slightly unpacked:By default, Spotify\\'s album view shuffles the album\\'s tracks when youhit Play; if that seems like a strange design choice, your perceptionsare well-tuned.

It means we adapt. We made a deliberate effort to \"adjust focus\" last year, for the last5-6 weeks of the year, and we\\'ll be renewing those efforts for the finalweeks of 2021. Here\\'s some of what\\'s coming before 2021 ends: Some of the Same. We\\'re not completely abandoning formula here.We\\'ll still be perusing the news and digesting the best for you... justnot as much of it. Come to think of it, this is why Quick CLIKKs were invented (late lastyear). And boy how the scope has creeped on those, amirite? Seriously,even we are not totally sure what\\'s the difference between Quick CLIKKsand CLIKK This anymore. So that\\'s something we\\'ll discuss at... theCLIKK\\'s End-of-Year Planning. This is an internal meeting, butwe mention it just to say (A) we might have more to share later and (B)we\\'re finally gonna sort out a few of those kinks that we\\'ve willfullyignored for a while.\\xa0  Greatest CLIKKs of 2021.

       " 'Plus: \"Tinderbox\" hits shelves | Tuesday, November 23, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 23, 2021👋 Good morning! 📆\\xa0Coming tomorrow: The NWSL is turning 10, and the USWNT is still fighting for equal pay. Tomorrow, we dive deep into the state of women\\'s soccer.Today\\'s word count: 1,713 words (6 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: ♟ Chess\\' grand reintroductionIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0The World Chess Championship between Norway\\'s Magnus Carlsen and Russia\\'s Ian Nepomniachtchi begins on Friday, 1,094 days after Carlsen won his fourth consecutive title, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Why it matters: During the long, COVID-fueled layoff, chess entered a new era, and with the championship finally here, the age-old game is ready for its close-up.By the numbers: When the world shut down in March 2020, countless activities exploded in popularity, but few experienced bigger booms than chess.Chess.com, the leading online platform, had about 30 million members when the pandemic began. By February 2021, it had 57 million. Today? Nearly 76 million.Sales increased, too, bolstered by Netflix\\'s mega-hit, \"The Queen\\'s Gambit.\" In the five weeks after its October 2020 release, sales of chess sets (87%) and books (603%) skyrocketed in the U.S.The big picture: Most booms died down as the world opened back up, but chess has sustained its momentum by evolving in real time.Chess pros like five-time U.S. champion Hikaru Nakamura began streaming games on Twitch in March. By June, he had 400,000 followers; now he has 1.3 million.Non-chess Twitch streamers also began playing, turning chess into an esport and introducing millions more to the game.Carlsen himself put on a virtual tournament in April 2020 that featured more exciting, rapid- or blitz-style games, garnering 2.7 million hours of viewership across two weeks.Between the lines: The title match — a best-of-14 duel held at Dubai\\'s Expo 2020 — is shaping up to be an all-timer between the potential GOAT and an intriguing challenger.Carlsen, who plays by the book better than anyone, has held the title since 2013, when he took down then-five-time reigning champ Viswanathan Anand.Nepomniachtchi plays a lightning quick, aggressive style that could spell trouble for the champ. \"He\\'s not afraid of Magnus,\" one grandmaster told FiveThirtyEight. \"I don\\'t think he\\'s afraid of anybody.\"How to watch: You can follow along on NBCSN, which is airing an hour of coverage each night as it capitalizes on the game\\'s newfound popularity.Go deeper: The business of being World Chess Champion (NYT)\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL power rankings: Week 12Table: Axios VisualsThe first-place Patriots, winners of an NFL-best five games in a row, have leapt into the top five of our power rankings, Jeff writes.State of play: They\\'ve reached these heights on the strength of the league\\'s best defense and on the arm of rookie QB Mac Jones — our current pick for Offensive Rookie of the Year.

PierzynskiAlex RodriguezJimmy RollinsMark TeixeiraHow it works: Players need at least 75% of the vote in a given year to be elected, and have just 10 years to reach that threshold. They must also receive at least 5% any year to remain on the ballot.Voters, who can select up to 10 names each year, are Baseball Writers\\' Association of America members with at least 10 consecutive years of service.401 voters cast a ballot last year, meaning 21 votes were needed to remain and 301 were needed for election.State of play: Controversial stars Curt Schilling (71.1% last year), Barry Bonds (61.8%), Roger Clemens (61.6%) and Sammy Sosa (17%) are entering their final year on the ballot.Eight of 11 newcomers last year fell off after the first vote. Only Mark Buehrle (11%), Torii Hunter (9.5%) and Tim Hudson (5.2%) get a second chance.Scott Rolen, entering his fifth year, was the only other player to receive at least 50% of the vote in 2021 (52.9%).Ballots are due on Dec. 31, and results will be announced on Jan. 25.Go deeper: A new Hall of Fame ballot is a chance to remember (NYT)\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosKeep up with your home team with Axios Local\\xa0\\xa0Get a daily digest of what\\'s happening in your hometown with Axios Local newsletters.Local reporters will deliver the latest news and insights on sports, politics, and more.Subscribe for free.\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning round Courtesy: USFL🏈 USFL reborn: The USFL will return in April with eight teams: Birmingham Stallions, Houston Gamblers, Michigan Panthers, New Jersey Generals, New Orleans Breakers, Philadelphia Stars, Pittsburgh Maulers and Tampa Bay Bandits.🎓 NIL for good: Michigan RB Blake Corum started the holiday cheer early, using NIL money to buy 100 Thanksgiving turkeys for families in need.🏈 No fun league: Pat McAfee went on an epic rant against the NFL\\'s new taunting policy, targeting his ire at one ref in particular he dubbed \"the fun police.\"🏀 Dancing king: Iman Shumpert on Monday became the first former NBA player to win \"Dancing with the Stars.\"⚽️ Good read: The rise and fall of the soccer hooligan who ruled Manchester (Reid Forgrave, SI)\"A murder mystery wrapped in a history lesson wrapped inside a sweaty, ecstasy-fueled rave.\"\\xa0\\xa05. 🏀 Men\\'s poll: No. 1 vs. No. 2 tonightTable: Axios VisualsGonzaga and UCLA remain firmly atop the rankings ahead of their heavyweight matchup tonight in Las Vegas (10pm ET, ESPN), Jeff writes.State of play: The Bulldogs and Bruins earned all but one first-place vote.

It\\'s also the first World Cup held outside May, June or July to avoid Qatar\\'s searing summertime heat.Notes:Who\\'s in: 13 of 32 countries have already qualified, including host nation Qatar (No. 51 in FIFA world rankings).

The network\\'s first program of any kind was a Rangers–Canucks game.\"\"He\\'s able to trace the decline to 1999, when HBO announced it would stop airing Wimbledon matches after 25 years ...

Photo: Maxim Guchek/BELTA/AFP via Getty\\xa0Migrants are \"dying in the snow\" along the Belarus-Poland border, caught in freezing temperatures between hostile border guards from both countries and cut off from lifesaving aid, Stefan Lehmeier of the International Rescue Committee tells Axios.Setting the scene: Lehmeier spoke by phone with Axios today immediately after helping to administer first aid to three Iraqi men suffering from hypothermia in a forest on the Polish side of the border. Lehmeier and his fellow aid workers gave them blankets, hot soup and waterproof boots. \"We\\'re really worried because it\\'s getting so cold now that I don\\'t think, even with the stuff we left them with, they\\'ll have a good chance of survival,\" says Lehmeier, the IRC\\'s deputy Europe director.The big picture: EU officials accuse Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko of waging \"hybrid warfare\" on the bloc — which has sanctioned Lukashenko for election-rigging and other abuses — by allowing thousands of migrants to travel from the Middle East to Minsk and then pushing them to the border.Desperate to reach Poland and thus the EU, the migrants are \"pawns in the hands of the Belarus forces,\" which choose when and how they attempt to cross, Lehmeier says, in some cases physically forcing people across barbed-wire barriers.Polish authorities have responded by establishing an \"exclusion zone\" reaching up to 3 miles into Polish territory. Journalists and aid workers are barred from entering and, Lehmeier says, migrants discovered there are being illegally forced back to the border.There have been cases of migrants crossing a frigid river to Poland and then immediately being forced back into the water when they reach the other side, Lehmeier adds.NGOs have established a hotline to dispatch aid to those who reach Poland, but the migrants \"are so afraid of everyone that they only call someone to come to them — they only give away their coordinates, so to speak — if they know that if they don\\'t do that, this will be the end,\" Lehmeier says.Border guards are \"tracking us and harassing us,\" Lehmeier says. Meanwhile, volunteers from Poland\\'s Territorial Defense Forces seem to be acting as vigilantes, he says, searching for refugees and puncturing the tires of the aid workers seeking to help them.\"There\\'s a good chance that next spring or whenever this exclusion zone is lifted, local residents or border guards might go through this forest and find corpses everywhere.\"— Stefan LehmeierState of play: On the Belarusian side of the border, officials cleared a large refugee camp in recent days and relocated around 2,000 people to a warehouse. A few hundred Iraqis have boarded repatriation flights, many of them already having spent their life savings trying to reach the EU. Officials in Brussels are scrambling to stop additional flights to Belarus and are hoping Lukashenko may be backing down.Still, Polish officials contend that every night, Belarusian forces are pushing more migrants to the border.On the Polish side, there seems to be no clear system for who is sent back across the border, who is taken to a detention center, and who might actually get to claim asylum, Lehmeier says.\"There basically is no rule of law right now here in the border zone,\" he says.The big picture: The situation is representative of the EU\\'s wider approach to migration at its external borders, Lehmeier notes, whether that be in the Mediterranean Sea or the Polish snow.Go deeper: The NYT on why Iraqi migrants are risking everything\\xa0\\xa02. The next phase of vaccinating the worldData:\\xa0Our World in Data;\\xa0Map: Kavya Beheraj/AxiosWe’re approaching an inflection point where the biggest barrier to expanding access to COVID-19 vaccinations should no longer be vaccine hoarding in rich countries, but delivery in the poorest ones, Seth Berkley, CEO of the Gavi vaccine alliance, told Axios in an interview at Gavi’s offices in D.C.What he’s saying: “We had no supply, or very little supply, and it was slowly going up,” says Berkley, who is also the point person on the global COVAX Initiative. “And, of course, the big concern has been the countries that were left behind.”“That supply is now coming in a big way, and so we will stop seeing supply as a barrier pretty soon, but then there will still be some countries that lag behind now and that’s because of these bottleneck issues,” Berkley says.Breaking it down: One of COVAX’s core goals for 2021 was ensuring that at least 20% of the population in every country was vaccinated. Around 60 countries are currently short of that mark, and 42 have yet to hit 10%, including most of Africa.Berkley says most poor countries can absorb all the doses they\\'re receiving, but when they run their weekly assessments \"between 18 and 25 countries come up red.\"The challenges range from shortages of supplies like syringes or health care workers to utilize them, issues with the \"cold chain\" needed to transport and store Pfizer and Moderna doses, vaccine hesitancy, or inadequate logistical planning, Berkley says.In countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 0.1% of the population has had the first dose, it can be all of the above.Deliveries can also be unpredictable or arrive with little time before doses are set to expire. Among the 92 lower-income countries being supported by COVAX, half have used less than 75% of the doses they\\'ve received, according to an analysis from the COVID Global Accountability Platform.What to watch: COVAX is working on a country-by-country basis to try to solve those challenges, Berkley says, whether that means sourcing equipment or sending in medical teams.But COVAX is now starting to consider “readiness indicators” of each country’s ability to distribute doses before shipping them, and he acknowledges that some countries with very low vaccination rates will only fall further behind in the coming months.\\xa0\\xa03. Global news roundupCasting ballots in Vallenar, Chile. Photo: Javier Torres/AFP via Getty\\xa01. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is back in office, having been reinstalled Sunday by the military leaders who deposed him a month earlier.What they’re saying: Hamdok says he wants to prevent further violence and pave the way for elections by 2023. But leaders of the pro-democracy movement have denounced the deal as cover for continued military rule and said they’ll continue their protests.2. The first round of Chile’s presidential election on Sunday set the stage for a Dec. 19 runoff between a far-right ex-congressman, José Antonio Kast, and left-wing former student leader Gabriel Boric, who received 28% and 26%, respectively.Why it matters: The ultra-polarized election could have a profound impact on the future political course of Chile, which is also in the process of rewriting its constitution. Chile is relatively prosperous and stable, but deeply unequal.3. Many Indian farmers who have protested for over a year are not satisfied with the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has backed down and restored price floors for rice and wheat — they’re now protesting to extend those protections to all produce, Reuters reports.4. Unvaccinated people in Kenya will be denied access to many businesses, restaurants and government offices starting next month, Axios’ Noah Garfinkel writes, even though just 5% of the population is fully vaccinated. The goal is to increase the pace of vaccination.\\xa0\\xa0A message from AxiosStart a new daily habit.\\xa0\\xa0Every weekday morning, host Niala Boodhoo catches you up quick on the latest news and interesting stories you won\\'t hear anywhere else.In 10 minutes, you’ll hear the latest in everything from politics to space to race and justice.Listen now for free.\\xa0\\xa0Bonus: Where in the world?Screengrab via Apple Maps\\xa0Tonight we\\'re heading to Canada and stopping in the capital (marked with a red pin) and the five largest cities.

Photo illustration: Annelise Capossela. Photo: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images\\xa0The leader of the European Parliament\\'s first official delegation to Taiwan tells Axios\\' Zach Basu the EU is slowly waking up to the threat posed by the Chinese government — but is held back by companies, particularly in Germany, that act as \"lobbyists\" for Beijing.Driving the news: Raphaël Glucksmann, a French human rights activist who has quickly become one of Europe\\'s most influential voices on China, told Axios in a wide-ranging interview that he is seeking to \"break the taboo inside the European institutions\" on engaging with Taiwan.Glucksmann, 42, dismissed the notion that this month\\'s visit — which drew a stern warning from Beijing — was a \"provocation,\" and he argued that stronger EU support for Taiwanese democracy will actually deter China from launching an invasion.\"We should not be terrorized and paralyzed by the fear of authoritarian regimes\\' reactions to our policies,\" Glucksmann stressed.Flashback: Glucksmann and four fellow European parliamentarians were placed on Beijing\\'s sanctions blacklist in March for their advocacy over the genocide in Xinjiang. In response, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to freeze ratification of a major EU-China investment deal. Glucksmann says there\\'s \"no chance\" that deal will ever be passed, and he\\'s pushing for the EU to upgrade its trade ties with Taiwan in its place.In the interview, Glucksmann warned that if the EU\\'s executive branch wants to be \"chickenshit on Taiwan,\" the European Parliament will hold it accountable by refusing to ratify other trade priorities.Glucksmann says one major barrier to stronger European action on China is Germany, where he says political leaders have bet big on economic ties with China and companies like Volkswagen act as \"ambassadors of Chinese interest.\"What to watch: Glucksmann said the EU\\'s policies toward China will determine whether it can be an \"adult player\" independent of the U.S.: \"If we don\\'t manage to be stronger in our relation with China, then it means that Europe will remain weak forever.\"Go deeper: Europe\\'s China critics embrace Taiwan\\xa0\\xa05. Activists in Balkans raise alarm on rising violence against womenProtesters march with the slogan \"Murder of women should be treated as national priority!\" in Pristina, Kosovo, on Aug. 26. Photo: Ferdi Limani/Getty Images\\xa0Sheila Bakia was 19 when she was killed in Montenegro. Albanian Sabrina Bengaj was killed at 23. Marigona Osmani was just 18 when she was beaten to death in Kosovo. Driving the news: Authorities believe all three women were killed by their husbands or ex-partners, and all three recent murders have sparked mass calls for change, Axios\\' Ivana Saric writes.The big picture: Ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women this week, activists across the Balkans are highlighting how the systemic failures to monitor and prevent femicide have allowed violence against women and girls to continue unchecked.1 in 2 women murdered in the Western Balkans last year were killed by a husband or partner, according to a recent report by several NGOs in the region. Reporting domestic violence continues to carry a cultural stigma in many Balkan countries. When cases are reported, police and other officials often don\\'t treat them seriously enough, women\\'s rights advocates say. The bottom line: Reversing the increase in violence against women will require an \"entire system\" change, Croatia\\'s gender equality ombudsperson, Višnja Ljubičić, told Axios.\\xa0\\xa06. Data du jour: Abandoning business travel39% of respondents who took at least three business trips before the pandemic told a Morning Consult poll they don\\'t ever expect to travel for work again.Many expect to wait at least another six months (13%) or a year (14%) before resuming business travel.When it comes to leisure travel, though, 65% of frequent pre-pandemic travelers expect to take a trip in the next six months, and just 7% say they\\'re done traveling for good.Methodology: Poll conducted Oct. 22–24, among 2,200 U.S. adults, with a margin of error of ±2%.\\xa0\\xa07.

Register here.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningPhoto: \"Axios on HBO\"\\xa0Why are all of those cranes standing upright?That\\'s what I kept thinking last Tuesday morning, while driving to a boat berth around halfway between the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, for an \"Axios on HBO\" interview with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen.Some cranes were operating, but the majority were idle at 8am and around half remained that way as we toured the port and docked a few hours later. In one case, we saw three cranes unloading a large container ship but a fourth crane — just feet away — sitting unused. Forget 24/7. These terminals weren\\'t fully operating 8/5.My big takeaway was that America\\'s supply chain crisis, which has driven prices higher and made all sorts of goods harder to find, may last long after the holiday season. Some of that is because of current problems, including unprecedented U.S. consumer demand and shortages of everything from trucks to chassis to yard space to workers.Some of because of coming concerns, including port worker union negotiations, new carbon emission regulations and a possible container shortage in Asia.Watch: Here are a couple of clips from the interview with Petersen, who\\'s logistics company was valued by VCs at more than $3 billion when it last raised funding in 2019. One about the supply chain, and one about what happened after his viral tweetstorm from last month.Bonus: A few observations from the boat, while chatting with Petersen off camera:We saw dozens of ships anchored offshore. Among them were several smaller ones that Petersen says would normally remain intra-Asia, but which likely came to the U.S. because of the sky-high freight fees they can currently fetch.Some of the larger ships weren’t 100% packed with containers. Petersen said one cause was those high shipping costs, which really hit smaller exporters.Lots of the older ships were in rough shape, illustrating the challenges in retrofitting for environmental improvements.Terminal cranes are obviously more advanced than they were decades ago, but they\\'re still designed to pick one container at a time. Petersen sounded like a man who\\'d like to help invent a more dynamic device.Oh, we also saw pelicans and a sea lion. From a boat that\\'s normally used for at-sea burials, which apparently is a cottage industry that needs further reporting. The boat next in the berth next to us was filming an episode of NCIS (which led to some amusing confusion when I arrived ahead of my camera crew).The bottom line: The size of the supply chain problem is like the size of a container ship. It gets bigger the closer up you look.\\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyKKR offered to take Telecom Italia (BIT: TIT) private for around €33.2 billion, or €0.505 per share (45% premium to Friday\\'s closing price), including the assumption of more than €20 billion in net debt. Why it\\'s the BFD: This would be one of the largest-ever leveraged buyouts of a European company. It also sets up a possible battle between KKR and French media giant Vivendi, TIM\\'s largest outside stockholder, which paid an average of more than €1 for each of its shares.Details: KKR\\'s offer is described as nonbinding and indicative, and would need approval from both the company and the Italian government.The bottom line: \"KKR\\'s plan would see TIM carve out its fixed network to be run as a government-regulated asset along the model used by energy grid company Terna or gas grid firm Snam ... The government wants any plans for TIM\\'s grid to be in line with the goal of rapidly completing broadband rollout across Italy, supported by adequate investments, and protecting jobs.\" — Reuters\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• MoonPay, a Miami-based \"PayPal for crypto,\" raised $555 million in first round funding at a $3.4 billion valuation co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue. http://axios.link/fqIk • Deliverr, an S.F.-based e-commerce fulfillment company, raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation.

       " 'Plus: Shortstops for sale! | Monday, November 22, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 22, 2021👋 Happy Monday! Welcome back.📆\\xa0Coming Wednesday: Following Saturday\\'s title game, the NWSL enters the most important offseason in its history — all while the USWNT\\'s Equal Pay battle continues. We\\'ll dive deep in Wednesday\\'s special edition.Today\\'s word count: 1,887 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🇨🇳 The Peng Shuai showdownPeng Shuai on a video call with IOC president Thomas Bach. Photo: Greg Martin/AFP via Getty Images\\xa0Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star who disappeared after accusing a former top government official of sexual assault, reemerged this weekend — but this story is far from over.Driving the news: Peng held a 30-minute video call on Sunday with IOC president Thomas Bach. According to the IOC, she is safe and well at her Beijing home and asked for privacy at this time.Chinese state media journalists published photos and videos showing Peng allegedly sitting in her bedroom, eating dinner with friends and attending a tennis event.China\\'s state-owned broadcaster released a statement from Peng that read more like a hostage note. In it, she said her sexual assault allegation was \"untrue\" and that \"everything is fine.\"State of play: The unverified videos, photos and statement have been met with widespread skepticism, and the IOC call didn\\'t satisfy WTA CEO Steve Simon, who has threatened to pull tournaments out of China and is demanding a proper investigation.It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don\\'t alleviate or address the WTA\\'s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion.[The IOC video] does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.— WTA statementThe backdrop: The Peng scandal comes amid calls to boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics over China\\'s human rights record. Last week, President Biden said the U.S. is \"considering\" a diplomatic boycott.The IOC has faced intense backlash for holding the Games in Beijing, and was criticized for being slow to respond to Peng\\'s disappearance.The organization put its reputation further on the line with Sunday\\'s video call, a seemingly casual chat that some have labeled a \"publicity stunt.\"The big picture: After decades of mostly silence from corporations, the WTA\\'s willingness to challenge the Chinese government, demand transparency and risk losing millions of dollars is \"radical and transgressive,\" writes Slate\\'s Ben Rothenberg.\"We\\'ve grown so accustomed to silence when there\\'s money at stake in the China market,\" tweeted The Economist\\'s Gady Epstein.Could the tide be shifting as the Olympics approach? Or is Simon\\'s aggressive posture destined to be a mere footnote in history?\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL Sunday: Taylor makes MVP casePhoto: Joshua Bessex/Getty Images\\xa0Johnathan Taylor continued his breakout campaign on Sunday, scoring five times — and winning countless fantasy matchups — in the Colts\\' 41-15 win over the Bills (Scorigami!).Notes:Parity party: It\\'s been nearly impossible to identify the truly great teams this season. Sunday didn\\'t help, with four first-place teams\\xa0— the Bills, Titans, Cowboys and Packers\\xa0— all losing.Another walk-off: The Vikings\\' walk-off win over the Packers was their sixth game decided on the final snap (3-3 record). League-wide, there have been 23 walk-offs, the most ever at this point of a season.View from the top: Through six weeks, the Patriots were 2-4 and looking up at the 4-1 Bills. Six weeks later, New England (7-4) has supplanted Buffalo (6-4) atop the AFC East.Road warriors: The Cardinals beat the Seahawks, 23-13, to improve to 6-o on the road, with all six wins coming by double digits. Arizona is now an NFL-best 9-2 despite Kyler Murray missing three weeks.MNF in Tampa: The \"ManningCast\" should be a blast tonight for Bucs-Giants given Tom Brady\\'s history with both brothers (and of course, Eli\\'s history with the Giants).🦃 Turkey Day losers ...

The last time the Longhorns lost this many games in a row, Dwight Eisenhower was in the Oval Office (1956).Irish on a roll: Notre Dame has posted five straight 10-win seasons for the first time ever — an impressive run that came in the wake of their disastrous 2016 season (4-8 record). Hats off to Brian Kelly.Three-win Huskers: Nebraska is 3-8 with a +70 scoring margin, making them perhaps the best three-win team of all time.Mullen axed: Dan Mullen is out at Florida — an unprecedented fall from grace. He\\'s the 13th coach fired this season, which has to be some kind of record.Still perfect: The UT-San Antonio Roadrunners kept their undefeated season alive with a miracle TD in the waning seconds against UAB. Meep! Meep!🏆 Heisman race ... Bryce Young had 559 pass yards in Alabama\\'s win over Arkansas (second-most in SEC history), while C.J.

This past season, he mashed 45 HR and led all position players with 7.3 WAR while playing mostly second base.Trevor Story, 29: He had a bit of a down year at the plate in 2021, but his 40 HR potential would be quite the consolation prize for teams that miss out on the three guys above.Javier Báez, 28: The flashiest defender of the bunch is the least consistent at the plate, but he\\'s shown how valuable he can be when he puts it all together, finishing second in 2018 NL MVP voting.The backdrop: These players are part of a golden generation of shortstops. A position long known for light-hitting defensive wizards is now home to MVP-level sluggers.The market for this year\\'s class was boosted after Fernando Tatis Jr. (14 years, $330M) and Francisco Lindor (10 years, $341M) signed mega-deals in the spring.For teams with smaller budgets, glove-first shortstops like Andrelton Simmons and José Iglesias are also available.What to watch: With the clock running out on the current CBA (expires Dec. 1), the biggest deals may not come until a new deal is reached — perhaps as late as February or March.\\xa0\\xa06. 🇺🇸 Photos across America Photo: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesLOUISVILLE, Ky. — The Washington Spirit beat the Chicago Red Stars, 2-1, on Saturday to win their first NWSL title — a storybook ending to a season filled with controversy and chaos.🎥 Watch: Kelley O\\'Hara\\'s game-winner (Twitter) Photo: Nic Antaya/Getty ImagesDETROIT — LeBron James was ejected Sunday night after elbowing Isaiah Stewart in the face.

But institutional inflexibility has left us at risk of further COVID waves and disruption and unprepared for the inevitable next pandemic.Driving the news: On Friday, the FDA endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for anyone 18 and over.That will increase the number of Americans eligible for a booster by tens of millions, but it comes after a number of experts called for the FDA to speed up widespread booster approval and after several states were already moving on their own to expand eligibility. It will also come too late for Americans getting a booster now to have that added protection by the Thanksgiving holiday next week, as it takes one to two weeks for the full effect. COVID cases have risen 20% in the U.S. over the past two weeks.The big picture: The delay and confusion around booster eligibility is just one example of the institutional inflexibility that has hobbled the U.S. pandemic response beyond better-known problems of political polarization and vaccine refusal.Despite clear evidence of the drawbacks of remote education, Detroit public schools this week announced students would go remote on Fridays in December in an effort to reduce COVID outbreaks.Part of the justification for the switch was to provide more time for deep cleaning facilities, even though it has long been clear the risk of contracting the virus from surfaces is low.Some government officials are recommending Americans who have family and friends over for indoor Thanksgiving celebrations remain masked and socially distant — advice that seems both unrealistic and outdated at this point.Though rapid diagnostics are now more available, they still cost as much as $12 per test — far higher than in countries like Germany and the U.K. that have rolled them out widely with government support — and too high for most people to do regular screening.Context: There are many reasons the U.S., despite its wealth and expertise, has one of the highest COVID death rates in the world — not least an entrenched and politically polarized antivax movement, fueled in part by social media, that has helped keep full vaccination rates in the U.S. below poorer countries like Ecuador and Sri Lanka. But institutions and experts have also been slow to adjust to a changing reality, sticking to policies even after real-world evidence has undercut them — like the initial discouragement of mask wearing — and ignoring newer, more targeted interventions like widespread rapid testing.\"The pandemic has proved to be a nearly two-year stress test that the United States flunked,\" sociologist Zeynep Tufekci wrote in the New York Times. As a result, when it comes to institutional trust, \"America is bankrupt.\"The bottom line: The nearly 800,000 Americans who\\'ve died so far from COVID-19 are proof we\\'ve lost this pandemic, but if the U.S. finally exits it without\\xa0fundamental change, it\\'ll be set up to lose the next one. Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. New COVID test offers quick PCR-quality results at homeThe Detect COVID-19 test. Credit: Detect, Inc.\\xa0A new COVID-19 molecular test delivers PCR-quality results to users at home in one hour.The big picture: The new test is a sign of the innovation COVID has sparked in the home diagnostics industry, bringing the power of the lab into the home.How it works: The new test from Detect, a Connecticut-based health tech company, \"takes the accuracy of a PCR test in the lab and puts it in a form factor that makes it easy for anyone to use and inexpensive enough for anyone to afford,\" says Eric Kauderer-Abrams, Detect\\'s chief technology officer.Users take a swab sample from each nostril, which is then mixed with freeze-dried chemical reagents contained in the cap of a small plastic tube. After being placed in the reusable Detect hub, the test searches for and amplifies the genetic code of any SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample, similar to the way a PCR test works in a professional lab.After an hour, the liquid-fueled tube is placed in a reader containing a lateral flow strip, with positive or negative results expressed with a single line, like an at-home pregnancy test, with a connected app that guides the process and can be used to verify and share results. By the numbers: The Detect test is 97.3% accurate, on par with a PCR lab test and better than existing rapid at-home antigen tests that look for the immune response to infection.Between the lines: The hub is reusable and reagents can be reprogrammed to search for other viruses. The company\\'s long-term vision \"is that you\\'ll be able to get a flu test or a COVID test or whatever you need, at home,\" says Owen Kaye-Kauderer, Detect\\'s chief business officer.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa03. OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 gets a little more openIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0The artificial intelligence research company OpenAI will eliminate the waiting list for access to the API of its natural language processing program (NLP) GPT-3.Why it matters: The move will accelerate access to the world\\'s best-known reading and writing AI model, and it\\'s a sign that OpenAI believes the program is safe enough — and can be monitored sufficiently — to be disseminated more widely.Driving the news: Developers from supported countries will be able to sign up to access GPT-3\\'s API and begin experimenting immediately, OpenAI said in an announcement Thursday morning.Previously, developers had to sit on a waiting list as OpenAI reviewed them before they could even get experimental access.\"We\\'ve added a lot of improvements across our API and added a number of safety features,\" says Peter Welinder, VP of products and partnerships at OpenAI. \"We think a lot of value can come from getting more developers to build solutions to problems that they see in their environments.\"Background: GPT-3 is a text-generating AI model that was trained on half a trillion words on the internet with 175 billion parameters — the values an AI aims to optimize during training — making it the largest and most sophisticated NLP model when it was released last summer.Yes, but: The ability to generate and tune human-like text at mass scale carries clear risks for misuse, especially in disinformation campaigns, though Welinder notes that the rate of misuse identified by OpenAI so far has \"been really, really low.\"How it works: Though the waiting list will be eliminated, developers will still need OpenAI\\'s approval for production-scale applications, and the company has created automated tools to identify problematic text generated by GPT-3.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsInvesting in the military community through Hiring Our Heroes\\xa0\\xa0Charter is building strong connections with the military community and the Hiring Our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program is just one of the ways we’re investing in them.

A more automated way to do IVFFertilis\\' new IVF petri dish. Credit: Fertilis\\xa0Australian company Fertilis has developed a new petri dish for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) that it says reduces human error and boosts success rates.Why it matters: As couples increasingly delay childbearing to later in life, the need for effective assisted reproductive technologies like IVF is only expected to grow.How it works: Standard IVF procedures require technicians to carefully move tiny amounts of cells to different environments in a petri dish, day by day, as the embryo develops before implantation in a mother.Fertilis\\' new petri dish, which uses 3D-printed micro medical devices, \"takes out some of the human handling needed and makes the process of embryo culturing more streamlined,\" says Jeremy Thompson, an early embryo biologist and the company\\'s co-founder and chief scientific officer.\"We have a system where we can flow these fluids through and make these necessary changes at a rate that\\'s consistent with the way that the body works, reducing stress on the embryo,\" says Marty Gauvin, Fertilis\\' CEO and co-founder.By the numbers: Fertilis says its technology can reduce the average number of IVF cycles required to get pregnant by between 30%–40%, which stands to make IVF more affordable and more reliable.What to watch: Ultimately, Fertilis wants to make IVF even more automated, removing what Thompson calls the \"human element\" from what is still a very artisan process.The company is partnering with IVF practitioners for clinical trials next year, with plans to make the technology widely available in 2023.Share this story.\\xa0\\xa05.

       " \"Plus: Crypto lingo lesson | Saturday, November 20, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By DealCloud\\xa0Axios Pro RataByKia Kokalitcheva·Nov 20, 2021Welcome to Pro Rata weekend, the pre-Thanksgiving edition. We're taking next Saturday off, but we'll be back after that to kick off the last month of 2021. This week, we're back in crypto-land, taking a look at what the modern VC looks like, catching up on a big week for DAOs, and giving you a cheat sheet on some of the lingo you may have seen swirling around the internet. Feel free to send me tips or comments by replying to this email or on Twitter @imkialikethecar.Today’s Smart Brevity™ count is 733 words, a 3-minute read.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Meet the modern crypto VCIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Crypto venture capital is a different game than traditional venture capital, which isn't something that every participating firm has yet to fully appreciate.The key is matching the asset class in which you're investing.Key attributes of the modern crypto VC: Registered investment advisers: Venture funds are exempt from registering as investment advisers, but only 20% of their holdings can be in “non-qualifying investments” like digital tokens. So it’s no surprise that a growing number of firms are registering with the SEC. Complying with custody and other requirements also makes limited partners feel more at ease.Tokens + equity: While some crypto investments are best done at the company level, others’ value is in the tokens (or eventual tokens). For example, about 75% of Andreessen Horowitz's current crypto fund’s capital is invested in tokens, partner Katie Haun said at an event last week. Some firms even manage more hedge fund-like vehicles that trade tokens, given the liquidity of many of these assets. Multi-stage: Paradigm Capital, which just raised a $2.5 billion fund, describes itself as an early-stage investor, but co-founder Matt Huang admits the firm won’t always catch every great investment in its earliest days, so it’s used to writing checks across all stages. It participated in crypto exchange FTX’s $900 million July round, for example. Research: Hiring smart tech researchers is all the rage among crypto funds, in part to build up their credibility with entrepreneurs and to keep them abreast of the latest trends and advances. “[Our research team’s] core work is to be on the frontier,” Huang tells Axios. Services: Crypto startups have some of the same help needs as other tech businesses (e.g., hiring, marketing, etc.), but they also have unique challenges. Navigating the fuzzy regulatory landscape and attracting quality contributors to their projects are among them. What they’re saying: “In the normal world, there’s existing software, or vendors or providers. In crypto, a lot of these solutions don’t exist,” says Huang, adding that his firm (and its peers) must build many of the tools it users to manage its own operations.“We view ourselves as a startup.” The bottom line: “You can’t get away with being just signal,” says CoinFund founder and CEO Jake Brukhman. “I think they have to be active participants [in the ecosystem].” \\xa0\\xa02. Crypto co-opsIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0“Decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAOs) — organizations that let owners of its digital tokens participate in decision-making — are having a big week. Driving the news: ConstitutionDAO raised more than $40 million in 72 hours and tried to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution during a Sotheby’s auction on Thursday night. Unfortunately for the collective and its participants, it got beat out, and had to conform to old-fashioned rules, such as setting up an LLC to actually make the bid.Meanwhile: Upstream, a two-year-old startup based in Miami, debuted a DAO-in-a-box software product so that folks won't have to cobble together disparate tools and apps. Yes, but: DAOs still face regulatory questions.Last week, the SEC halted American CryptoFed's registration of two tokens, citing improper documentation and information.ConstitutionDAO doesn’t appear to be a security. That may not be the case should the group do something else with the money raised other than returning it to the original donors. Wyoming continues to be the only state that recognizes DAOs as legal entities.\\xa0\\xa03. Crypto speakIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0Here’s some crypto lingo, and what it means: gm: “good morning” — the crypto community picked it up as a friendly greeting.ngmi: “not gonna make it” — refers to missing out on profits from a trade, although it’s also used to call out crypto skeptics’ misguided views and moves.“looks rare”: as non-fungible tokens — NFTs — exploded over the past year, rarity has become a value driver. As with most things in internet culture, it’s also being used ironically.“probably nothing”: a tongue-in-cheek signal that something is potentially very significant.(📜,📜): The U.S. Constitution DAO folks used the scroll emoji as their rallying cry.gas fees: Fees that users pay to Ethereum protocol miners to verify their transactions. \\xa0\\xa0A message from DealCloudIs tech holding your firm back?\\xa0\\xa0Dealmakers need data and technology at their fingertips in order to compete.

       " 'Plus: America\\'s fifth major sport | Friday, November 19, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 19, 2021🎉 Happy Friday! Looks like there were some technical issues today — apologies this is late.💪 Must-see video: Got a little emotional last night watching A.J. Brown open up about mental health. Worth a watch.Today\\'s word count: 1,779 words (7 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🎟 Sports tickets meet NFTsIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The mobile revolution\\xa0replaced paper tickets with digital barcodes. Now comes the next leap: upgrading barcodes to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Driving the news: Teams and leagues are experimenting with NFTs as a way to increase the value of digital tickets, with the ultimate goal of rewarding (and thus increasing) attendance.In some cases, the ticket is the NFT, which can be collected or resold. Think: digital ticket stubs.In other cases, the ticket grants access to a separate NFT, which can also be collected or resold. Think: digital bobbleheads. Screenshot: NFL NFTsExample No. 1: The NFL announced Thursday that it will attach NFTs to tickets for 21 select games this season. Once attendees scan into the game, they\\'ll receive an email with a link to obtain their NFT.Tickets must be purchased through Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek to be eligible. The NFTs can be stored on Ticketmaster or sold on its marketplace.Side note: The NFL also sold 4,000 collectibles representing each NFL team for $10 each on Thursday (pictured above, nothing to do with tickets). Those are all now selling for hundreds on the resale market. Screenshot: Mavs CollectiblesExample No. 2: The Mavericks are giving NFTs to home game attendees, also via Ticketmaster. Some are digital ticket stubs (see above), while others are \"MetaMavs Legends\" (the pixelated dudes above).\"The whole idea is to reward fans for coming,\" says Mavs owner Mark Cuban. \"You can\\'t just buy a ticket and not go. What gets you the NFT is that you actually [scan your ticket]. And if you go to 10 games ... there will be rewards for that.\"\"Let\\'s say Luka has a 30 assist game,\" adds Cuban. \"There are going to be 500,000 people that say they were there, right? But the reality is, the people who are actually there are the ones who get the NFT commemorating that game.\"Food for thought: The Mavericks are retiring Dirk Nowitzki\\'s No. 42 on Jan. 5. Instead of commemorative shirts, perhaps fans will get Dirk-inspired NFTs that can be collected or sold (for way more than a shirt).The big picture: The magic of NFTs is that they create verifiable digital scarcity and ownership. We communicate digitally. We work digitally. We live digitally. Why should collectibles be any different?\"The bobblehead was all the rage for years, and teams definitely saw higher ticket prices on \\'Bobblehead Night.\\' But if you think about that value prop, it\\'s not that great.\"\"You have to get there super early. You have to carry it around all game and not lose it. And then you get home and put it on your desk. ... The physicalness actually reduces the value, I think. So transitioning to a digital version makes a ton of sense.\"— Brad Griffith, CEO and founder of ticketing app GametimeWhat\\'s next: For now, these attendance-based NFTs are still linked to actual tickets, which are used to enter the venue. In the future, the NFTs could be the tickets, themselves.All transactions would be stored on the Blockchain, thereby increasing transparency and all but eliminating fraud.NFT tickets would also allow the original seller (e.g. a sports team) to track all resales, and get a cut each time the ticket changes hands.\\xa0\\xa02. ⚽️ America\\'s fifth major sportIllustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios\\xa0NBCUniversal has retained the rights to broadcast Premier League games in the U.S. for the next six years, Axios\\' Sara Fischer and I write.Details: The new deal gives NBC exclusive rights to air all 380 Premier League matches across its linear and streaming platforms, including NBC, USA Network, Peacock, Telemundo and Universo.The new deal is worth $2.6 billion over six years, which roughly triples the current deal, per Sports Business Journal.The deal is a loss for ESPN, which had been eyeing the rights package via a combined bid with CBS.By the numbers: NBC will pay the Premier League ~$430 million per year. By comparison, ESPN and Turner are paying the NHL a combined ~635 million per year under their new deal.What they\\'re saying: \"The definition of a major sport is largely about money. And, if soccer in this country wasn\\'t already here, it is now official with [this deal],\" writes NY Post\\'s Andrew Marchand.\"While NBC lost the NHL, it clearly valued the Premier League more than hockey. Its final number to retain the rights shows it.\"The bottom line: There may only be four major sports leagues in America, but there are five major sports.\\xa0\\xa03. ⚾️ Ohtani, Harper win MVP awardsShohei Ohtani (L) and Bryce Harper (R).

This will be done via the introduction of what the SEC calls \"universal proxy cards.\"Most outside shareholders vote via proxy.Between the lines: This change will give investors more say and flexibility, in keeping with the SEC\\'s ethos under Biden/Gensler (not surprisingly, this rule change was first floated under Obama). It also could make it easier for activists to gain a foothold in the boardroom, but possibly harder for them to assume board control.The new rule also requires some additional disclosures and explanation on proxy cards, and a requirement that activists solicit shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the voting power (although that solicitation can simply be via passive postcard, so it\\'s a pretty toothless guardrail).Look ahead: Expect to see more activist campaigns, now that the bar has been lowered for them to acquire at least some boardroom influence.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Sierra Space, a Louisville, Colo.-based commercial space transportation and infrastructure company, raised $1.4 billion in Series A funding at a $4.5 billion valuation. Why it\\'s the BFD: This is one of the largest VC raises ever for an aerospace company, and moves Sierra Space closer toward its ultimate goal of  building a private space station in orbit. In the meantime, it\\'s also working on low-orbit spaceplanes that can deliver cargo and, eventually, crew.Investors: Coatue, General Atlantic and Moore Strategic Ventures co-led, and were joined by BlackRock, AE Industrial Partners and family offices of Stanley Druckenmiller and Vincent Viola.History: Sierra Space was formed earlier this year via a spinout from Sierra Nevada Corp., which said the move was partially designed to secure outside investment.The bottom line: \"Sierra Space\\'s planned space station, Orbital Reef, is a joint project with Jeff Bezos\\'s Blue Origin and may be operational by 2027. Companies seeking zero-gravity or microgravity environments for pharmaceutical research, 3D-printed human organs, or work in fiber-optics, energy and semiconductors, have expressed interest in station, [CEO Tom] Vice said.\" — Gillian Tan, Bloomberg\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Lacework, a San Jose, Calif.-based data security company, raised $1.3 billion in Series D funding at an $8.3 billion valuation co-led by insiders Altimeter Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Sutter Hill Ventures and Tiger Global.

Without eventhinking about our particular audience, it made sense to us that theextremes would be the smaller groups because... By definition, Newbies are less likely to know about theCLIKK (andby the time they get here, they\\'re rapidly approaching Apprentice). As the highest rank in a linear path, Veterans should be the rarestfolks out there-and the Veterans who do find theCLIKK are less likelyto \"need\" it.\\\\u2696\\\\ufe0f We\\'ve been trying to balance for the middle this whole time.2\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Still, y\\'all have a bit more (collective) experience than weguessed. If you had given us the numbers above and told us to guesswhich belonged to which group, we\\'d have assigned the percentages in thereverse order of what you see above (Apprentice biggest, thenJourneyman, then Newbie, then Veteran). 3\\\\ufe0f\\\\u20e3 Experience levels represent potential segmentations. If theCLIKKwere to expand its publishing and start a second (parallel) newsletter,the defining difference between newsletters could be AudienceExperience. Put another way: if theCLIKK had to split into two newsletters, onecould aim for the greener groups and the other could aim for theseasoned groups.  Got an idea for a CLIKK spinoff?

OH, and THIS...18 Definitions from The Devil\\'s Dictionarya.k.a. Bierce\\'s Master Class in Smart-AssYou can read the Wikipedia pageif you want morecontext, but the one-sentence nutshell is that The Devil\\'s Dictionary isliterally a dictionary-a book of words in alphabetical order-exceptAmbrose Bierce re-wrote all of the definitions as witheringly sarcasticjokes. Some of the styling is recognizably old-timey, but a lot of itwas wayyyyyyy ahead of its time. If you like the samples below, just know that you can read the wholething  on ProjectGutenberg (TL;DR it\\'s old enough and they have a generous license).Admiration  Our polite recognition of another\\'s resemblance toourselves.Alliance  In international politics, the union of two thieves whohave their hands so deeply inserted in each other\\'s pocket that theycannot separately plunder a third.Cabbage  A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about as large and wiseas a man\\'s head.Conservative  A statesman who is enamoured of existing evils, asdistinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others.Dog  A kind of additional or subsidiary Deity designed to catch theoverflow and surplus of the world\\'s worship. This Divine Being in someof his smaller and silkier incarnations, takes, in the affection ofWoman, the place to which there is no human male aspirant. The Dog is asurvival-an anachronism. He toils not, neither does he spin, yetSolomon in all his glory never lay upon a door-mat all day long,sun-soaked and fly-fed and fat, while his master worked for the meanswherewith to purchase an idle wag of the Solomonic tail, seasoned with alook of tolerant recognition.Egotist  A person of low taste, more interested in himself than inme.Harangue  A speech by an opponent, who is known as anharangue-outang.Hostility \\\\u2604\\\\ufe0f A peculiarly sharp and specially applied sense of theearth\\'s overpopulation.Interpreter  One who enables two persons of different languages tounderstand each other by repeating to each what it would have been tothe interpreter\\'s advantage for the other to have said.Nose  The extreme outpost of the face. From the circumstance thatgreat conquerors have great noses, Getius, whose writings antedate theage of humor, calls the nose the organ of quell. It has been observedthat one\\'s nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs ofanother, from which some physiologists have drawn the inference that thenose is devoid of the sense of smell.Telephone \\\\u260e\\\\ufe0f An invention of the devil which abrogates some of theadvantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.Telescope  A device having a relation to the eye similar to that ofthe telephone to the ear, enabling distant objects to plague us with amultitude of needless details. Luckily it is unprovided with a bellsummoning us to the sacrifice.the JEDI-LEVEL STUFF \\\\u2b07\\\\ufe0fConversation  A fair for the display of minor mental commodities,each exhibitor being too intent upon the arrangement of his own wares toobserve those of this neighbor.Education  That which discloses to the wise and disguises from thefoolish their lack of understanding.Logomachy  A war in which the weapons are words and the woundspunctures in the swim-bladder of self-esteem-a kind of contest inwhich, the vanquished being unconscious of defeat, the victor is deniedthe reward of success.Medicine  A stone flung down the Bowery to kill a dog in Broadway.Quiver  A portable sheath in which the ancient statesman and theaboriginal lawyer carried their lighter arguments.Sycophant  One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he maynot be commanded to turn and be kicked.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

       " 'Plus: Dinner with team Navalny | Thursday, November 18, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By MethaneSAT\\xa0Axios WorldByDave Lawler·Nov 18, 2021Welcome back to Axios World.We’ve got a packed edition for you tonight (1,796 words, 6½ minutes), starting with a scoop on Marriott and China, looking at India’s free pass from Biden, and sitting down for dinner with Alexei Navalny’s top team. Please spread the word about Axios World and subscribe here.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Marriott refused to host Uyghur conferenceIllustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios\\xa0The Marriott hotel in Prague declined to host a conference of activists and leaders from China\\'s Uyghur diaspora this month, citing \"political neutrality,\" an email shared with me and my colleague Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian shows.Why it matters: The Chinese government has condemned the World Uyghur Congress, which has attempted to rally global attention to the genocide in Xinjiang, China. The decision to reject the conference reflects China\\'s growing ability to extend authoritarian control beyond its borders by making clear to corporations that crossing the party\\'s red lines will be bad for business.The World Uyghur Congress consists mainly of Uyghurs living in exile and advocates for the rights of those who remain in the Xinjiang region in western China, where upward of 1 million people have been held in internment camps.About 200 delegates from 25 countries gathered in Prague Nov. 12–14 to elect the organization\\'s new leadership and hold discussions with politicians, academics and civil society representatives from around the world. The Prague Marriott Hotel declined to host the conference.Melissa Froehlich Flood, Marriott\\'s senior vice president for global corporate communications, told Axios the hotel would be \"contacting the group to apologize, as the hotel\\'s response was not consistent with our policies.\"How it happened: Working with local partners in Prague, organizers for the conference reached out to several hotels for quotes, Zumretay Arkin, the Munich-based program and advocacy manager for the World Uyghur Congress, tells Axios. The group then sent a representative to visit the Marriott.\"At first, the person didn\\'t mention the background information on the conference and the organization that was organizing it,\" Arkin says. That information came up during the visit.Not long thereafter, an email arrived from an events manager at the hotel:\"Thank you very much for your visit today. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that we are not able to offer the premises. We consulted the whole matter with our corporate management. For reasons of political neutrality, we cannot offer events of this type with a political theme. Thank you once again for your time and understanding.\"— Oct. 1 emailBetween the lines: Marriott frequently hosts political fundraisers and events.Flood clarified in a statement to Axios that hosting the conference would not have violated any \"political neutrality\" policy and said the reference to \"corporate management\" in the email referred to \"hotel-level management.\"The U.S.-based company does have a history of flare-ups involving China, its biggest international market.Marriott International issued a profuse apology in 2018 after Chinese authorities shut down its booking website over an online questionnaire that listed Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as countries, rather than regions of China.Also in 2018, Marriott fired a U.S.-based employee who used a company Twitter account to like a post by a pro-Tibet group.The big picture: The World Uyghur Congress has repeatedly drawn the ire of Chinese authorities, who have declared it a terrorist group for allegedly fomenting unrest in Xinjiang, though the group does not promote violence and is on no international terrorist lists.Ahead of the conference, the Chinese Embassy in Prague condemned the Congress and the politicians who participated.Prague Mayor Zdeněk Hřib, who attended the conference, said in response: \"I hear that China is unhappy about this conference being held here in Prague. Well, I am unhappy there\\'s a country in 2021 that has concentration camps.\"\\xa0\\xa02. India\\'s free passPresident Biden meets with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September. Photo: Sarahbeth Maney-Pool/Getty Images\\xa0For the second consecutive year, the State Department bypassed a\\xa0recommendation\\xa0from an independent government commission to name India to its \"red list\" of countries engaged in \"systematic, ongoing, and egregious\" violations of religious freedom, Axios\\' Zach Basu reports.Why it matters:\\xa0Strengthening ties with India has featured prominently in both the Trump and Biden administrations\\' strategies for countering China, which New Delhi\\xa0now regards\\xa0as its biggest security threat. Former President Trump had no qualms about embracing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist who was once\\xa0banned from entering\\xa0the U.S. over \"severe violations of religious freedom\" during his time as governor of the state of Gujarat.But for President Biden, who has pledged to place human rights at the \"center\" of his foreign policy, the issue is far more delicate.Still, Biden has pressed ahead by\\xa0hosting Modi\\xa0at the White House and\\xa0forging new ties\\xa0through the Quad, a strategic dialogue between the U.S., India, Japan and Australia that Beijing views as hostile. Biden also\\xa0reportedly plans\\xa0to invite India to his Summit for Democracy next month.Between the lines: \"I do not believe for a second that the United States has a foreign policy centered on human rights, no matter what Biden or anyone says,\" Ashley Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Axios. \"Foreign policies are anchored in very sensible notions of interests, and human rights are one interest among many. They have never been and will never be at the center of U.S. foreign policy or U.S. strategic policy.\"What\\'s next:\\xa0The next test of Modi\\'s free pass will be whether India is sanctioned for acquiring Russia\\'s S-400 air defense system, which is required under the Countering America\\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Turkey was sanctioned for a similar purchase.\\xa0\\xa03. Team Navalny fights onLeonid Volkov (right) with Alexei (center) and Yulia Navalny in 2016. Photo: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\\xa0With their leader jailed, their organization declared an “extremist” enterprise and their staff forced into exile, the leaders of Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation are intent on keeping up the pressure on Vladimir Putin, and on keeping Navalny alive.What they’re saying: “We have a slogan that Putin has to regret that he pushed us out of the country,” says Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s top adviser.Exile is both painful and liberating. Now operating out of Vilnius, Lithuania, Volkov says he’s no longer in and out of prison and no longer has to worry that any equipment the foundation purchases will be confiscated by Russian authorities. “It’s a matter of principle” to show that they are “just as strong without Navalny next to us” and wouldn’t stop even if he were to be killed, says Maria Pevchikh, head of the foundation’s investigative unit, which produced the “Putin’s Palace” investigation that generated 120 million views on YouTube. There’s more where that came from, she says.Plus, with additional time on his hands, Navalny is coming up with too many “brilliant” ideas for new projects for his team to even keep up with, Volkov quips. They communicate through his lawyers.Setting the scene: Volkov and Pevchikh spoke to a small group of reporters over dinner on Wednesday night at an Italian restaurant in Washington.They were in town for meetings with the administration and on Capitol Hill, to push Congress to finalize sanctions Navalny proposed on 35 key Putin associates, and for Volkov to testify at a congressional hearing Thursday on kleptocracy.They also want to keep Navalny’s name in the political and media discourse to increase the pressure on Putin to release him, or at least decrease the odds of another assassination attempt.Flashback: Navalny was arrested in August after returning to Russia from Germany, where he was recuperating from Novichok poisoning.Both Volkov and Pevchikh say they were certain he would return. But did they know he’d be arrested?“We didn’t know and we were sure at the same time,” Pevchikh says. Volkov notes that he and Navalny spent four days in Germany game-planning how the organization would function if Navalny were jailed.Pevchikh became the subject of wild conspiracy theories from the Kremlin propaganda machine after Navalny’s poisoning, including that she had staged the whole thing on behalf of the U.K.’s MI6 spy agency. Now their former colleagues who remain in Russia face the threat of retrospective arrests.The bottom line: “Everyone understands that his sentence is a life sentence,” Volkov says. “The question is whose life.”\\xa0\\xa0A message from MethaneSATWe need to cut methane fast.

What I\\'m reading: Should we want the Taliban to succeed?A Taliban fighter guards a shipment of humanitarian aid. Photo: Valery Sharifulin\\\\TASS via Getty\\xa0Yaroslav Trofimov asks a provocative\\xa0question in a recent WSJ long read: Should the U.S. want the Taliban to succeed?Breaking it down: Starting from the reality that the militants are firmly entrenched in power, U.S. policymakers have a few broad options:Undercut and oppose the Taliban so the group doesn’t grow in clout and legitimacy and inspire similar movements elsewhere, as some GOP hawks suggest.Maintain leverage over the Taliban with carrots and sticks in an attempt to shape the group’s behavior — including toward terror groups like al-Qaeda — as seems to be the Biden administration’s general approach.Actively cooperate with the Taliban on issues of mutual concern — such as helping to pay the salaries of schoolteachers, medical workers and potentially civil servants — and lift sanctions and asset freezes.This is not a thought exercise. The imminent threat of starvation looms over half the population, per the World Food Program. A cash crunch, due in part to U.S. asset freezes, has left the economy barely functional.In responding to the almost unfathomable scale of the humanitarian crisis, the Biden administration will have to weigh the extent to which it is willing to help a Taliban government function.Yes, but: A senior European official put it this way to Trofimov: “There is so much history here, with the wounds, the humiliation. …  You cannot expect the West to act totally coldhearted and rational.\"\\xa0\\xa07.

       " 'Plus, SSE bucks the breakup trend and the next dragon. | Thursday, November 18, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By RBC Capital Markets\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Nov 18, 2021🚑 I\\'m pleased to share that the upcoming Axios Pro newsletter on health tech deals will be co-authored by Erin Brodwin and Sarah Pringle.Erin comes to us from STAT, and her name came up nonstop when I asked health tech investors who to hire.Sarah previously led healthcare coverage at PE Hub, constantly breaking deal scoop, and also wrote the daily Wire newsletter (which has historical ties to Pro Rata).Be sure to join the waitlist.\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0Donald Trump was president when SPACs stopped being a cottage industry and instead became Wall Street Waterfront. Now he might be indirectly responsible for reining in some SPAC excesses.Driving the news: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) yesterday sent a letter to SEC chair Gary Gensler, asking his agency to investigate the proposed merger between Trump\\'s amoebic social media company and a SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Corp., as first reported by NY Times DealBook.She’s particularly interested in a NY Times report that Digital World’s chairman and CEO Patrick Orlando held talks with Trump before the SPAC filed for its IPO in May or priced it in September. Those discussions apparently were related to a proposal that Axios scooped in April.SPAC sponsors are not allowed to source potential merger targets prior to the SPAC going public, and DWAC made multiple representations in its IPO filings that its executives had followed the rules. DWAC, currently valued at nearly $2 billion, may try to argue that DWAC didn\\'t exist when Orlando talked with Trump, thus it couldn\\'t have done anything untoward. But that may be a tough legal hill to climb, since Orlando did have other active SPACs (particularly if there\\'s any paper trail linking the Trump opportunity to DWAC\\'s creation).What DWAC is alleged to have done is not unusual in SPAC-land. In fact, it\\'s the industry\\'s dirty little secret that many SPAC sponsors, particularly serial ones like Orlando, source deals before they\\'re technically supposed to. Securities regulators so far have turned a blind eye to the practice, which corrupts the legitimacy of being a blank check company.The bottom line: Warren\\'s letter, and the NY Times investigation on which it\\'s based, may shine a spotlight that\\'s impossible for the SEC to ignore. And if there is a crackdown, it could impact lots of SPACs that have nothing to do with Donald Trump or his social media dreams.\\xa0\\xa0The BFDIllustration: Brendan Lynch/Axios\\xa0SSE, the listed British utility with a market cap of nearly $23 billion, disclosed plans to sell 25% stakes in its transmission and distribution grid units, but said it won\\'t spin off the businesses into independent companies. It also doesn\\'t plan to separate out its renewables assets.Why it\\'s the BFD: This not only bucks the recent trend of corporate breakups — as employed by GE, J&J and Toshiba — but also pushes back against the wishes of activist investor Elliott Management.Not alone: Bayer CEO Werner Baumann yesterday said that his company wouldn\\'t follow rival J&J down the breakup path.The bottom line: \"No doubt emboldened by its success at\\xa0EDP-Energias de Portugal, where it pushed for asset sales to reinvest in green projects, and then saw shares of EDP\\'s\\xa0listed renewables\\xa0arm surge,\\xa0Elliott\\xa0had been meeting privately with SSE\\'s representatives and investors to make its case for a breakup.\" — Fareed Sahloul, Bloomberg\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Formstack, a Fishers, Ind.-based workplace productivity platform, raised $425 million co-led by Silversmith Capital Partners and insider PSG. http://axios.link/T5oq🚑 Generate Biomedicines, a Cambridge, Mass.-based developer of protein-based medicines, raised $370 million in Series B funding from founder Flagship Pioneering and co-investors ADIA, Fidelity, Alaska Permanent Fund, Arch Venture Partners, Altitude Life Science Ventures, Morningside Ventures and T.

PLUS: a colorful question for 2021\\'s penultimate poll.But first...CLIKK THIS... 18 Main Types of Marketing (Examples Included).This was an unusual butvery solid find from the Ahrefs blog. It\\'s unusual because, while we see tons of articles like this, each witha similar headline and a similar View of Marketing From Ten ThousandFeet, the huuuuuuuuuge majority of those articles suck. HYPOTHESIS  This is a popular blog-post idea for novice copywritersand/or those who are very new to the marketing space. Leaving aside their unsightly and cacophonous name, Ahrefs tends to be avery credible source; their tools are best-in-class and their blogcontent is extremely solid. This post is no exception, and it finallydoes the topic justice. As such, it\\'s a good opportunity to plug anyholes in your marketing vocabulary.As a preview, here\\'s their list of 18 types (add \"Marketing\" aftereach):Digital  Offline  Inbound  Outbound  Content  SearchEngine  Growth  B2B  B2C  Affiliate  Social Media Brand  Direct  Influencer  Email  Word-of-Mouth Event  GuerrillaQU!CK CLIKKs Rage-Shake Your Phone to Report an Instagram Outage.This is not a joke. Instagram\\'s latest app update includes a new featurewhereby violently shaking your phone with Instagram open will cause itto ask you if everything\\'s OK and if you\\'d like to report a problem withthe app.Not sure whether to scoff and cynically label this a Public-RelationsRed Herring, or laugh and say \"hey, why not.\" Also in the update: you can now remove one image from a carousel withouthaving to delete the whole thing. Better late than never.\\\\u2702\\\\ufe0f 4 Story-Splitting Techniques.We mentioned splintering a.k.a. buffalo-inga few days ago. These terms refer to the practice of breaking downlonger-form content (like webinars and blog posts and presentations)into smaller pieces of content for use elsewhere (like posting on socialmedia).This infographic is a natural follow-up, and it\\'s very quick: just fourdifferent criteria across which you can slice and dice the content intouseful splinters. Twitter Activity and the 80/20 Rule.Granted, we\\'re dorks and we probably think too much-but we continue tobe amazed by the explanatory power of the 80/20 Rule (originally knownas the Pareto Principle). Once you know this rule of thumb, you start tosee examples of it just about everywhere.Here\\'s our quick 80/20 primer for business and marketing folk.Thenumbers don\\'t need to be exactly 80 and 20, by the way. The underlyingprinciple is simply that the majority of effects stem from a minority ofcauses. Now back to Twitter! A new study from Pew Research finds that 97% of all tweets on Twitterare produced by a mere 25% of Twitter\\'s users. Our minds immediatelywent to the 80/20 Rule, and this seemed like a classic example right infront of our faces. We kept scrolling and reading, wishing that the numbers were a littlecloser to 80 and 20. Right then, we read the next statistic: 82% of alltweets are either replies or retweets, as opposed to the 18% of originaltweets. It\\'s like the Twitter link wanted to be an 80/20 example. It even \"triedharder\" when the numbers weren\\'t close enough for our liking. Why Netflix Never Goes Down.Thisdoesn\\'t contain any practical information, but it\\'s cool to know. It\\'sthe answer to a good question we never asked.The first thing to understand here is that physical distance really doescut into internet bandwidth; the farther you are from someone, theslower and less reliable the data stream between y\\'all. This problemcompounds when everyone in the world is participating and most of thoseusers are thousands of miles from (say) the Netflix office and theirmain servers. You\\'ve probably heard of content delivery networks (CDNs). They\\'rebasically interconnected servers spread across large areas, and theydirect each site/platform visitor to the nearest server rather than TheOnly Server Way Far Away. This keeps connections fast and reduces thepossibility of The Only Server getting overwhelmed. A lot of folksalready use CDNs.But the gist of the link is that Netflix basically has their owncustom-built CDN called Open Connect, and Netflix HQ keeps each of thoseservers updated with its own copy of the Netflix library. So if you ever think to yourself \"huh, Netflix is down,\" check yourmodem, because it probably means that your ISP is experiencing aregional outage (not Netflix). the Penultimate QUICK POLL of 2021What is your level of marketing experience?Click the option which best describes you.NEWBIE  You\\'re currently in the \"fish out of water\" stage.Also known as the \"drinking from a fire hose\" stage. You could reallyuse a crash course. You prefer that explanations start at the verybeginning.\\xa0\\xa0APPRENTICE  You\\'re really starting to get it.You\\'re grasping how the different parts of marketing connect together,though you still lack experience outside of your comfort zone.JOURNEYMAN  You can safely declare yourself \"T-shaped.\"You\\'ve been doing this stuff for long enough to feel fluent, even if youhaven\\'t gotten deep and dirty with every single discipline.What does \"T-shaped\" mean?  This is the idea that a marketer shouldhave deeper expertise in 1-2 areas and competence (or at leastfamiliarity) in all other areas. Like the shape of a capital T.VETERAN \\\\u2694\\\\ufe0f You\\'ve been doing this s**t for a long time, and thensome.  You\\'ve spent countless hours of your life traversing the marketingtrenches. You\\'ve probably been a marketer longer than certain marketingdisciplines (like SEO and Social) have even existed.CLARIFICATIONS:  The above options reflect differences of experience, NOTintelligence. We can safely assume a baseline level of smaht acrosstheCLIKK\\'s audience (and thank God for that). Industry experience is atotally separate thing. Which means... There is zero shame in being a newbie. Everybody has to be a newbieat some point. If we had to pick, we\\'d prefer the newbie end of thespectrum because there\\'s more opportunity for us to help. So please,shout it loud and proud if that\\'s you!\\\\u2696\\\\ufe0f Responses won\\'t affect theCLIKK\\'s writing style or editorialapproach. Instead, your responses will help us calibrate the degrees ofdetail in our email content.If we\\'re explaining XYZ in theCLIKK, the middle 80% of that explanationwill be the same regardless of y\\'all\\'s experience levels. But there\\'salso the Elementary 10% on one end and the Advanced 10% on the otherend, and whether it\\'s best to include one of those (or both) ultimatelydepends on the audience\\'s experience level.ADVERTISE // LICENSE OUR CONTENT//\\xa0\\xa0SUBSCRIBE Copyright ©2021 Modern Publisher, LLC.

       " 'Plus: Florida stinks | Thursday, November 18, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Drone Racing League\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 18, 2021👋 Good morning! Which city deserves an NFL expansion team? Let us know at the bottom of today\\'s edition.Today\\'s word count: 1,640 words (6 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🎓 Catching up on realignmentIllustration: Lazaro Gamio/Axios\\xa0Sister Jean and the Loyola-Chicago Ramblers announced Tuesday that the school will be moving from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Atlantic-10 in 2023, Axios\\' Jeff Tracy writes.Why it matters: Loyola-Chicago is the 24th D-I school in the past five months to announce a new league affiliation — a reshuffling that began in July with a shocker: Oklahoma and Texas to the SEC in 2025.State of play: The Sooners and Longhorns are moving because as good as the Big 12 is, the SEC is better and more lucrative. That decision has had a domino effect, with schools now playing musical chairs.Joining SEC (2025): Oklahoma and Texas (from Big 12)Joining Big 12 (2023): Cincinnati, UCF and Houston (from American); BYU (independent)Joining American (2023): UAB, Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, North Texas, Rice and UTSA (from C-USA)Joining C-USA (2023): Liberty and New Mexico State (independent); Jacksonville State and Sam Houston (from FCS)Joining Sun Belt (2023): Old Dominion, Southern Miss and Marshall (from C-USA); James Madison (from FCS)FCS moves (2022): Incarnate Word (Southland to WAC); Texas A&M Commerce (D-II Lone Star to Southland); Austin Peay (OVC to A-Sun)Non-football moves (2023): Loyola-Chicago (MVC to A-10)The big picture:\\xa0The\\xa0European Super League\\xa0may have failed, but the idea behind it — money over everything — is alive and well in America.Oklahoma and Texas\\xa0will turn the SEC into a 16-team juggernaut, bringing college football closer to creating a\\xa0super league\\xa0of its own.New rivalries will be born (or re-born, in the case of Texas-Texas A&M) — but only after old rivalries and beloved traditions die.The bottom line: This isn\\'t the first,\\xa0nor will it be the last\\xa0major wave of realignment. But amid a time of drastic change in college sports, it could end up being the most significant.\\xa0\\xa02. 🏈 NFL power rankings: Week 11Table: Axios VisualsThe Titans, winners of six straight and owners of the easiest remaining schedule, have ascended to the top of our weekly rankings, Jeff writes.The intrigue: Tennessee has reached these heights despite a near-historic rash of injuries. A whopping 82 players have taken the field for the Titans, two shy of the most ever for a full season (49ers last year).📆 Coming up: Week 11 kicks off tonight with a Super Bowl LI rematch (28-3, anyone?). Kansas City hosts the big one Sunday: Cowboys at Chiefs.Tonight: Patriots (-6.5) at FalconsSunday\\'s best: Colts at Bills (-7); Packers (-2) at Vikings; Saints at Eagles (-1.5); Cowboys at Chiefs (-2.5)Sunday night: Steelers at Chargers (-5.5)Monday night: Giants at Bucs (-11)Byes: Broncos, Rams\\xa0\\xa03. 🏏 Cricket sets sights on AmericaIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0The world\\'s second-most popular sport is preparing to make a splash stateside, Jeff writes.What\\'s happening: The U.S. on Tuesday was named co-host of the 2024 T20 World Cup, a major global event that will take place a year after Major League Cricket — a domestic T20 league — debuts.The backdrop: As MLC builds out its infrastructure, including a flagship stadium in Dallas, it will do so with the World Cup in mind. The U.S. will host 18 matches in 2024, while co-host West Indies will host 37.Currently, there\\'s just one World Cup-ready venue in the U.S. (Central Broward Park in Florida), with Dallas slated to open in late-2022 as the second. That number will have to grow before 2024.Of note: Minor League Cricket, MLC\\'s little brother, launched this summer, playing 200 matches at a variety of venues across the country.The big picture: Cricket\\'s 2.5 billion fans worldwide trail only soccer\\'s 4 billion. The U.S. is home to just 30 million of those fans, but that number has more than doubled over the past decade.\"The cricket World Cup is one of the most-watched events in the world,\" Tom Dunmore, MLC\\'s VP of marketing, tells Axios. \"This will bring hundreds of millions of eyeballs to cricket in the Americas.\"While traditional test cricket\\'s five-day format may be a hard sell for an American audience, T20 matches are fast-paced and last just two to three hours. \"It\\'s really easy to get hooked on,\" says Dunmore.Zoom out ... Consider soccer 30 years ago: FIFA\\'s decision to award the U.S. with the 1994 World Cup was contingent on creating a top-tier domestic league. Two years later, MLS was born, and 25 years after that, the USMNT is ranked 13th in the world.Looking ahead: The ICC has another goal in mind, too: Bringing cricket back to the Olympics, where it\\'s been absent since 1900. They\\'re aiming for 2028 — in Los Angeles.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Drone Racing LeagueThe Drone Racing League launches Drone Racing Arcade mobile game\\xa0\\xa0The Drone Racing League (DRL), the world’s premier, professional drone racing property, launched the Drone Racing Arcade, a fun, free and easy mobile game made for brand integrations.Download it today on iOS and Android mobile devices.

Entering Saturday, Florida\\'s seven FBS programs are a combined 28-42. None are ranked, and just one has a winning record.UCF: 6-4Florida: 5-5Miami: 5-5FAU: 5-5Florida State: 4-6USF: 2-8FIU: 1-9The big picture: Florida is a recruiting hotbed, and its schools have appeared in eight national title games in the BCS and CFP eras, tied with Alabama for the most of any state.But the three traditional powers — Florida, Florida State and Miami — have fallen behind in recent years, losing games they used to win and losing in-state recruits they used to land.The Gators are in shambles after barely beating FCS Samford, the Seminoles are likely headed for their fourth straight losing season, and the Hurricanes have vastly underperformed their preseason No. 12 ranking.Barring a miracle, all three schools will finish outside the top 25 for the first time since 1978. Heck, even UCF has fallen into mediocrity after emerging as a national power a few years ago.The bottom line: Florida football has been fading for a few years. But not even the biggest haters saw this season going as badly as it has.\"In college football terms, this is as improbable as eating a bad meal in New Orleans or being unable to find a blackjack table in Las Vegas. You almost have to try to fail this dramatically.\"— Dan Wolken, USA TodayDo you live in the Tampa Bay area? Sign up for our Tampa Bay newsletter.

The wisdom was if you went in there, it would only make things worse. ... Now you go in, fix it and you\\'re OK for next spring.\"— Koufax, years laterThe big picture: The Brooklyn native joined his hometown Dodgers in 1955 at age 19, compiling a good but not great 4.10 ERA in his first six seasons.

       " 'Plus: Algorithmic warfare | Wednesday, November 17, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By Charter Communications\\xa0Axios FutureByBryan Walsh·Nov 17, 2021Welcome to Axios Future, whose naming rights, unlike LA\\'s Staples Center, are not currently for sale.If you haven\\'t subscribed, subscribe.Send feedback, tips and the worst-named arenas in the U.S. (see item No. 6) to bryan.walsh@axios.com.Today\\'s Smart Brevity count: 1,683 words or about 6 minutes.\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: Taming the wild west of AI-based hiringIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0New laws and regulations are aiming to draw some boundaries for the fast-growing but often black-box approach of using AI to hire employees.Why it matters: Companies large and small have embraced AI-based tools to screen, assess and select job candidates, but algorithmic approaches have been largely unregulated and risk perpetuating biases on race, gender, disability and more.Driving the news: Earlier this month, the New York City Council passed one of the first laws attempting to regulate the use of automation and AI in hiring, requiring New York-based employers to conduct a bias audit on automated tools before using them to evaluate job candidates.At the end of October, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced a new initiative to ensure AI tools used in hiring and other workplace decisions comply with existing federal anti-discrimination laws.By the numbers: As companies struggle to find workers — there are more than 10 million job openings, significantly higher than the number of unemployed workers — they\\'ve increasingly turned to AI and automation to streamline the hiring process. An estimated 99% of Fortune 500 companies use at least some form of an automated applicant tracking system for screening candidates, according to Jobscan.A worldwide survey of thousands of human resources professionals found their use of predictive analytics — an approach that uses AI-based tools to project how applicants might perform in a job — has increased from 10% in 2016 to 39% in 2020. How it works: The most basic and widespread version of AI hiring tools can screen thousands of resumes at the first stage of the job search, looking for specific terms and qualifications that match previously successful applicants.More advanced tools might use everything from facial and emotional analysis on video interviews to algorithmically analyzed computer games to predict a candidate\\'s personality and how well they might be suited for a specific position.\"Instead of just looking at resumes, we collect behavioral data through exercises that tell us about applicants\\' soft and social skills, and which are unbiased for race and gender,\" says Frida Polli, co-founder and CEO of New York-based Pymetrics, which provides hiring services for companies like McDonald\\'s and Kraft Heinz.The catch: For all the scientific-sounding promises of AI hiring vendors, the nascent field is closer to \"the Wild West,\" as Wharton School management expert Peter Cappelli has put it, with tools often subject to bias.What\\'s next: New laws like the one from New York City could help improve AI hiring tools by requiring them to undergo an audit for bias from an outside company.Polli notes that Pymetrics hired a team from Northeastern University to audit its algorithmic tests to ensure they didn\\'t produce a disparate impact on race or gender, and she says the New York law \"could be a big moment for the responsible regulation of this field.\"Yes, but: Matt Scherer, senior policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, says the New York law is too narrow, focusing on race and gender versus other characteristics like disability status or age and only looking at hiring, as opposed to the use of algorithms for assessment and promotion.\"There\\'s a real risk that the bill will be seen as the standard almost by default,\" he adds.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa02. Americans are confused about AIIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0A new poll about Americans\\' attitudes toward AI shows deep ambivalence about what the technology will do to their lives.The big picture: Americans fear the effect AI will have on employment, politics and privacy, but also believe it should play a bigger role in technology, manufacturing and more. In other words: Who knows?By the numbers: A new national poll of 2,200 adults by the Stevens Institute of Technology and Morning Consult found 74% of respondents believe AI will lead to a loss of personal privacy, 71% believe it will reduce employment opportunities, and 60% believe it will increase political polarization.A majority believe AI will be misused by governments, individuals and businesses.The other side: Despite those fears, almost two-thirds of respondents think facial recognition — an increasingly widespread AI application that deeply concerns many experts — is a responsible use of the technology.While loss of privacy was the biggest stated concern about AI, younger Americans were less worried — 62% of Gen Z respondents said they were worried about AI privacy, compared to 80% of baby boomers.Even as respondents expressed fears about automation and AI reducing jobs, more than half believed it could ultimately create better working conditions and 70% said it would reduce the risk of dangerous jobs.What they\\'re saying: \"There\\'s a lot of intelligence around how AI could potentially invade privacy, but there\\'s also a cautious optimism that I was encouraged to see,\" says Jason Corso, director of the Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence at Stevens Institute of Technology.Yes, but: Corso notes while half of the respondents believed AI is sufficiently regulated by the government, in fact, there is \"actually limited to no regulation right now.\"\"That tells me that we need more education about AI.\"Share this story.\\xa0\\xa03. An insider\\'s view of \"algorithmic warfare\"Illustration: Eniola Odetunde/Axios\\xa0Artificial intelligence will \"change the nature of war,\" according to Robert Work, a former deputy secretary of defense.Why it matters: Success on the battlefield will increasingly come down to the ability to make algorithmically aided decisions faster, and while the U.S. has long maintained a decisive technological advantage in warfare, its lead in AI is much narrower. What they\\'re saying: The ability to harness large numbers of intelligent systems crunching huge amounts of data from the battlefield will \"take out some of the uncertainty around war,\" says Work, who served under President Obama and briefly President Trump, and who is now an advisory board member to the AI company SparkCognition Government Services.\"The battle networks of the future will feature human-machine collaboration, and these things will operate at extremely high speed,\" he tells Axios. \"These are going to make battle networks that do not have AI obsolete.\"How it works: Think of AI less as a general than as the ultimate aide-de-camp, making sense of data from sensor networks and offering recommendation actions to commanders.\"You\\'re going to have machine-to-machine communication once those plans are made, it will populate through the forces really fast,\" says Work.The big picture: Speed kills in modern warfare, and the ability to analyze data and issue commands faster than your opponent can ensure battlefield dominance.Work points to a recent Pentagon war game that pitted a group of veteran officers working on their own against less-seasoned officers assisted by AI.Despite the experience gap, the younger officers — with AI — came out ahead, a sign that humans working in concert with machines can be more effective than either on their own.Read the rest.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsInvesting in the military community through Hiring Our Heroes\\xa0\\xa0Charter is building strong connections with the military community and the Hiring Our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program is just one of the ways we’re investing in them.

Photo: Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\\xa0An estimated 100,306 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in a 12-month period ending April 2021, according to new provisional data released by the CDC Wednesday, Axios\\' Jacob Knutson writes.Why it matters: It\\'s the first time drug overdose fatalities reached six figures in a 12-month period and signals that the country is on track to set another tragic milestone after reporting a record 93,331 drug deaths in 2020.The data presented is incomplete, as many cases require more investigating to confirm cause of death, though the agency\\'s estimates rarely largely differ from the final totals.What they\\'re saying: \"As we continue to make strides to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country,\" President Biden said in a statement Wednesday.The big picture: It\\'s roughly a 28% increase over the same time period a year earlier.Greater prevalence of synthetic opioids, specifically fentanyl, and the social and economic disruptions set off by the coronavirus pandemic are widely believed to be the cause of the increased deaths.Share this story.\\xa0\\xa05.

Photo: Brent Combs/NurPhoto via Getty Images\\xa0LA\\'s Staples Center will be renamed Crypto.com Arena after a naming rights deal with a Singaporean-based crypto exchange, Axios\\' Dan Primack reports. Why it matters: Joseph Kennedy, plutocrat father to President Kennedy, supposedly knew it was time to get out of the stock market in 1929 when he started receiving investment tips from his shoeshine boy. Changing stadium naming rights might be a new sign.Details: More than a few now-defunct companies at one point decided it was a good idea to spend millions to plaster their names on stadiums and arenas — usually at precisely the worst time.CMGI entered into a 15-year, $114 million deal in 2000 to put its name on the New England Patriots\\' new stadium, only to pull out and see its stock price drop from $40 to pennies after the dot-com bust.Enron paid $3.3 million a year to put its name on the Houston Astros\\' new field in 1999, only to collapse in an accounting scandal two years later — leading the Astros to buy back the name.The Baltimore Ravens\\' stadium was originally named after the internet provider PSINet, but had to be renamed after the company when bankrupt two years into the deal.The bottom line: Obviously, you should not use this newsletter for investment advice — I think that\\'s more Felix Salmon\\'s thing — but when a company in a new field lays millions out to put its name on an arena, maybe you should be a little wary.\\xa0\\xa0A message from Charter CommunicationsInvesting in the military community through Hiring Our Heroes\\xa0\\xa0Nearly 10% of Charter’s workforce has a military affiliation and our commitment to our nation’s heroes is strong.

       " 'Plus, the cheesiest VC deal. | Wednesday, November 17, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By RBC Capital Markets\\xa0Axios Pro RataByDan Primack·Nov 17, 2021\\xa0\\xa0Top of the MorningPhoto illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios. Photo: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\\xa0The Staples Center in Los Angeles will be renamed Crypto.com Arena, effective just before the Lakers host the Brooklyn Nets on Christmas Day.Why it matters: Cryptocurrencies are pushing deeper into the American mainstream. It\\'s a 20-year naming rights agreement between Crypto.com, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange and mobile wallet provider, and building owner Anschutz Entertainment Group. No financial terms were disclosed, but Axios hears the total value exceeds $700 million (which would make it the richest naming rights deal ever).For context, SoFi paid over $600 million for 20-year naming rights to the new NFL stadium in Los Angeles, where the Chargers and Rams play, while Intuit paid over $500 million for 23-year naming rights to a new arena that will house the Los Angeles Clippers.Behind the scenes: Staples originally paid around $120 million for a 20-year naming rights deal in 1999, when it was riding high as one of America\\'s preeminent retailers. 10 years later it renegotiated for permanent naming rights for an undisclosed amount.What no one knew, however, was that AEG was eager to bring in a fresher name. In early 2019 it quietly bought back the naming rights from Staples, which by that point was owned by private equity firm Sycamore Partners.Crypto.com this past summer heard that AEG was seeking out a new sponsor, and the two sides began hammering out a deal that involves several experiential and philanthropic components. Rationale: AEG gets to rebrand its building with something that feels more like the future than the past. For Crypto.com, it\\'s about elevating its brand in the capital of America\\'s entertainment and creator economy.Rival crypto exchange FTX, which today added star baseballer Shohei Ohtani as an investor, earlier this year paid $135 million for 19-year naming rights to the NBA arena in Miami.If Coinbase.com and Robinhood weren\\'t looking for arena deals yesterday, they probably are today.Yes, there are some echoes of the dotcom boom, when Internet upstarts entered the naming rights game. One of them, CMGI, faltered before its football field even hosted a single game (instead, the New England Patriots play at Gillette Stadium). The bottom line: Crypto is in. Retail is out.\\xa0\\xa0The BFD Source: GiphyGooder Foods, maker of a new \"better for you\" mac and cheese brand, raised $6.4 million from Springdale Ventures, Willow Growth Partners, Third Craft, Gingerbread Capital, Purple Arch Ventures and First Course Capital. Why it\\'s the BFD: America is deeply divided, but we can all agree that mac and cheese is delicious.The founding team includes former execs from Annie\\'s and Kraft, plus actress Gal Gadot. It\\'s also the fourth startup for CEO Jennifer Zeszut.The bottom line: \"Normally, the company would have staged a bunch of taste tests, but due to the pandemic, Gooder Foods created an online community, shipping out thousands of small bags of noodles for people to try. In fact, the company developed more than 1,000 versions of noodles to get the right one.\" — Christine Hall, TechCrunch\\xa0\\xa0Venture Capital Deals• Heyday, an S.F.-based DTC consumer products platform, raised $555 million in Series C funding.

       " 'Plus: The last soccer-less nation | Wednesday, November 17, 2021\\xa0 Open in appView in browser\\xa0Presented By GLOBAL X ETFS\\xa0Axios SportsByKendall Baker·Nov 17, 2021👋 Good morning! The first in-season edition of \"Hard Knocks,\" starring the Colts, premieres tonight on HBO (10pm ET).Today\\'s word count: 1,606 words (6 minutes).Let\\'s sports...\\xa0\\xa01 big thing: 🤑 Retail is out, crypto is inPhoto illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios. Photo: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\\xa0The Staples Center in Los Angeles will be renamed Crypto.com Arena, in what is believed to be the richest naming rights deal in sports history.Why it matters: Cryptocurrencies are pushing deeper into the American mainstream, Axios\\' Dan Primack writes.Details: It\\'s a 20-year naming rights agreement between Crypto.com, a Singapore-based crypto exchange and mobile wallet provider, and building owner Anschutz Entertainment Group.No financial terms were disclosed, but Axios hears the total value exceeds $700 million. A formal announcement is expected today.For context, SoFi paid over $600 million for 20-year naming rights to the new Chargers/Rams stadium, while Intuit paid over $500 million for 23-year naming rights to a new arena that will house the Clippers.The official transfer will occur on Christmas Day, inclusive of the Staples logo being replaced on the building\\'s iconic roof, just before the Lakers host the Brooklyn Nets.Behind the scenes: Staples originally paid around $120 million for a 20-year naming rights deal in 1999, when it was riding high as one of America\\'s preeminent retailers. Ten years later it renegotiated for permanent naming rights for an undisclosed amount.What no one knew, however, was that AEG was eager to bring in a fresher name. In early 2019 it quietly bought back the naming rights from Staples.Crypto.com heard this past summer that AEG was seeking out a new sponsor, and the two sides began hammering out a deal that involves several experiential and philanthropic components.Rationale: AEG gets to rebrand its building with something that feels more like the future than the past. For Crypto.com, it\\'s about elevating its brand in the capital of America\\'s entertainment and creator economy.Rival crypto exchange FTX earlier this year paid $135 million for 19-year naming rights to the NBA arena in Miami.If Coinbase and Robinhood weren\\'t looking for arena deals yesterday, they probably are today.The big picture: Yes, there are some echoes of the dotcom boom, when internet upstarts entered the naming rights game. One of them, CMGI, faltered before its field hosted a single game (instead, the Patriots play at Gillette Stadium).\\xa0\\xa02. 🏀 Curry gets \"MVP!\" chants in BrooklynPhoto: Nathaniel S.

The IOC has announced a new framework for transgender athletes that leaves decisions largely up to each sport\\'s governing body.\\xa0\\xa0A message from GLOBAL X ETFSCompanies at the leading edge of blockchain tech – in a single trade\\xa0\\xa0While famously associated with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, blockchain’s reach now extends to a growing number of uses.The Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) is designed to provide investors access to companies at the leading edge of this technology.Explore BKCH\\xa0\\xa04. ⚡️ Lightning roundIllustration: Aïda Amer/Axios\\xa0🏒 Penguins sale: Fenway Sports Group, the holding company that owns the Red Sox and Liverpool, is in talks to buy the Penguins.

Watch the trailer.\\xa0\\xa05. 🏈 CFP rankings: Top seven stays the sameTable: Axios VisualsThe top seven teams remained unchanged in the College Football Playoff\\'s third ranking of the season, unveiled Tuesday night.Why it matters: While chaos could still ensue, history tells us what we see today could be very close to what we see on Selection Day, Dec. 5.Of the past 28 semifinalists, 21 have been ranked in the top four at this point in the season, and 26 have been ranked in the top six.No team to make the playoff has ever been ranked lower than ninth at this point in the season.Of note: 13 of the 14 teams ranked in the top two at this point in the season went on to make the playoff — great news for Georgia and Alabama fans.

Photo: Tom Dahlin/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\\xa042 years ago today, a writer named Daniel Okrent inadvertently created one of the most popular games on earth: fantasy baseball.What happened: On a flight to Austin, a bored Okrent came up with a gambling-related baseball game that involved tracking real MLB players\\' stats on fake teams, jotting down some notes on a napkin.He pitched the idea to the colleagues he was meeting in Texas. They declined, but a few weeks later, a more receptive group of friends loved what they heard during a lunch in New York.By the 1980 season, their \"Rotisserie League\" — named after the restaurant where they ate lunch that day, La Rotisserie Française — held its inaugural draft.The big picture: Rotisserie leagues soon began spreading among MLB press boxes, and the internet\\'s rise the following decade led to the game\\'s first real boom (before then, all stats and scores were compiled by hand).Now, fantasy sports is a $22 billion industry globally, bolstered by the recent advent of daily fantasy.And while football has long since overtaken baseball in terms of popularity, none of it would exist if not for Okrent\\'s bored scribbling.🎥 Watch: \"Silly Little Game\" trailer (YouTube)\\xa0\\xa09. 🏈 NFL trivia Source: GiphyEli and Peyton Manning are one of eight pairs of brothers to have been named to the Pro Bowl or an All-Pro team in the same NFL season (2012).Question: Can you name the other seven pairs of brothers?Hint: Three pairs are still active.Answer at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa010. 👑 Stat du jour: King CristianoData: Axios Research; Table: Will Chase/AxiosCristiano Ronaldo (Facebook, IG, Twitter) is one of three people with a top 10 most-followed account on three social media platforms, joining Ariana Grande (IG, Twitter) and Will Smith (Facebook, TikTok).Go deeper: How to hit the top on each social platform (Axios)\\xa0\\xa0A message from GLOBAL X ETFSCompanies at the leading edge of blockchain tech – in a single trade\\xa0\\xa0While famously associated with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, blockchain’s reach now extends to a growing number of uses.The Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) is designed to provide investors access to companies at the leading edge of this technology.Explore BKCH\\xa0Talk tomorrow,Kendall \"Probably nothing\" BakerTrivia answer: Bruce and Clay Matthews (1989), Shannon and Sterling Sharpe (1993), Ronde and Tiki Barber (2005), Maurkice and Mike Pouncey (2014), Travis and Jason Kelce (2018), J.J. and T.J.

It\\'s David Frey\\'s classic 12-Step Foolproof Sales LetterTemplateand, while Frey may be teaching you to write a long-form sales letter,his 12-part system can be picked apart and applied to everything from aproduct page to a promo email to a Facebook ad.Pretty sweet. What else?\\xa0\\xa0You\\'re not easily satisfied, are you? :-) Ok, we often have a piece thatis 100% instructional. This will be some kind of tactic that you canimplement for your business or a client\\'s business right away. Like this:SHOPTALKAll products are potionsPeople will predictably do what you want them to do if they perceive thereward to outweigh the risk.It begins, of course, with having a great product or service. But evenproducts that supposedly \"sell themselves\" have great marketing behindthem.When you are marketing and selling, aim to stack value whilesimultaneously reducing the risk.Today, let\\'s talk about the value side of this equation.What do we find valuable?Remember that people don\\'t buy products or services. They buy outcomes.They buy identities. They buy increased status. They buy peace of mind.All products are potions. Before the customer drinks your potion, theyare in some less-than-ideal state. They are in pain, or there is somedesire (conscious or unconscious) that is unfulfilled.Stop for just a second and think about what you sell. Ask these twoquestions:* What less-than-ideal state is my prospect in before they drink ourpotion?* What transformation has occurred after they drink our potion?Read those two questions again if you need to ^^Whatever your answers to the questions above, make sure you paint thatpicture in your marketing and sales presentations.Here are a few ways to apply this to your marketing:* Trying to decide what image to use in an ad or on your website homepage? A safe bet is a photo of a person that drank your potion.* Writing a promotional email, ad, or sales page? Begin by describingthe prospect before your potion. Then, introduce your potion. Then,describe your prospect after your potion. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.* Trying to close a big sale? Don\\'t get too focused on describing andselling the potion itself. Instead, describe what it will feel likeafter they take a sip of your potion.Looks great!\\xa0 What else?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That\\'s all the spoilers we\\'re going to give you today but suffice it tosay that we love our readers and we work very hard to curate only thebest information, news, and tools for you every weekday. Here are three of the most popular links we\\'ve shared over the lastcouple of months:* A quick article(2mins) about how Google is stealing about half your search traffic.* A tool  that allows you to find a person\\'s emailaddress.* A library  of over 6 millionFacebook ads for your inspiration. So, how do y\\'all make the moneyz?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Good question.\\xa0 We sell advertising to companies that want to reach ourgrowing list of digital marketers.\\xa0 If you want to find out more aboutour advertising options, reply to this email and we\\'ll get you thedeets.\\xa0 We also sell digital marketing training courses and workshops likethese:* Lead Generation Mastery : Predictablybuild an email list of qualified prospects for B2B or B2C sales[Registration Fee: $295]* Email Newsletter Mastery : Howto Plan, Launch, and Virally Grow an Email Newsletter that NurturesLeads and Drives Sales [Registration Fee: $295]* How to Build an SEO Magnet  - Builda piece of content that attracts search traffic from Google like amagnet.
