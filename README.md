JARVIS stands for JUST A RATHER VERY INTELLIGENT SYSTEM.
JARVIS is originally known from the movie Iron Man. Jarvis is an AI that was created by the main character Tony Stark. We decided to implement that name to our project.


INTOR:
Jarvis is an email rule that can assist its users in classifying various emails as Spam. 
Which is similar to the Spam/ Ham rule. 
The email is being classified(labeled) by Jarvis based on the key words of the Subject line, as well as the body of the email. 
Jarvis will be assisting both the Innovation Center & Students.


Below are various steps taken during the production of JARVIS:
Creating a Test Email
Modifying Security Settings
Importing appropriate coding libraries
Extracting several emails as data
Creating an email sample, from emails that were displayed
Decoding, cleaning data from HTML to readable files
Analyzing our data
Implementing the Email Rule


GOAL:
Our Goals for Jarvis is to successfully learn what emails will be labeled as Spam or have important information. 
Jarvis will also grant the user the freedom of viewing their emails, effortlessly by a quick command.


Challenges Decoding & Missing Data：
Scraping emails from demo emails, then extracting data with IMAP to create the demo dataset.
Processing data and decoding HTML formatted emails, which are the byte messages, with Beautiful Soup to make them readable in our own dataset.


Conclusion：
Although we had some errors with the GMAIL API token and unable to successfully create a filter demo. 
We were able to work with the internal information calculating the true # of emails that were considered Spam. 
We had the pleasure of improving our critical thinking skills. There has been various trial and errors in the production of Jarvis. 
Jarvis was able to provide the user the ability to load any number of emails that they wished to display. 
We also became very knowledgeable, on how the Innovation Center helps students improve their skills sets. 
By providing courses that have been partnered with great companies!
